This section focuses on the empirical and substantive relevance of the
environmental variation at the center of a natural experiment.  Particularly,
this section reviews and discusses the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item diffusion/role of qualitative diagnostics to show:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the empirical, substantive, and policy relevance of the
                natural experiment
            \item the external validity (non-idiosyncrasy) of the natural
                experiment
            \item exclusion of `bundling of treatments' (i.e., environmental
                variations affecting the outcome through multiple causal
                pathways)
        \end{itemize}
    \item diffusion/role of placebo tests supporting the magnitude of the
        average treatment estimation on the treated  (ATT)
    \item diffusion/role of local average treatment estimation (LATE) 
        considerations
\end{itemize}
