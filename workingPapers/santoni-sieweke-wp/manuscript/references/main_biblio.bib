            Report (AR5) considers new evidence of climate change based on many
            independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate
            system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate
            processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the
            Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report
            (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a
            component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on
            Managing the Risks of Extreme Events to Advance Climate Change
            Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing
            weather and climate extremes. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM)
            follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative
            is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions
            which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are
            introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the
            methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in
            key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams'
            evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed
            as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high)
            and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood
            (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in
            the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and
            consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding,
            theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1.
            Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a
            finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model
            results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings
            are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty
            qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the
            specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty) The
            basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers
            can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in

            dynamics of institutional change in the Middle Ages. We have
            assembled a novel dataset, where information on political
            institutions for northern-central Italian cities between 1000 and
            1300 is matched with detailed information on the earthquakes that
            occurred in the area and period of interest. Exploiting the panel
            structure of the data, we document that the occurrence of an
            earthquake retarded institutional transition from autocratic regimes
            to self-government (the commune) in cities where the political and
            the religious leaders were one and the same person (Episcopal see
            cities), but not in cities where political and religious powers were
            distinct (non-Episcopal see cities). Such differential effect holds
            both for destructive seismic episodes and for events that were felt
            by the population but did not cause any material damage to persons
            or objects. Ancillary results show that seismic events provoked a
            positive and statistically significant differential effect on the
            construction and further ornamentation of religious buildings
            between Episcopal and non-Episcopal see cities. Our findings are
            consistent with the idea that earthquakes, interpreted in the Middle
            Ages as manifestation of the will and outrage of God, represented a
            shock to people's religious beliefs and, as a consequence, enhanced
            the ability of political-religious leaders to restore social order
            after a crisis relative to the emerging communal institutions. This
            interpretation is supported by historical evidence.},

Moreover, a movement towards introducing moderation to quadratic relationships has emerged. By reviewing 110 articles published in SMJ from 1980 to 2012, we identify several critical issues in theorizing and testing of these relationships for which current

These include insufficient causal argumentation, incorrect testing, mixing up two different types of moderation, and not realizing that the curve can flip completely. For these and other issues, a guideline is provided which, when followed, may bring clarity to theoretical motivation and rigor to empirical testing.},

Motivation theory and the emerging body of empirical literature suggest that awards can have a significant effect on employee motivation and corporate performance, though not always in the intended direction. Awards can also destroy value. The organizational award literature has so far largely neglected this important issue. We develop a synthesis of the dimensions critical for successful award bestowals, and analyze under which conditions awards generate firm-specific value that is sustained and difficult for competitors to imitate. The process of value creation and capture is contingent on the given firm's organizational characteristics and nature of production. The article concludes by laying out empirical implications. JEL codes: M52, M54, J24, J30. Managerial summary: Awards are widely used in the corporate sector. They fundamentally differ from monetary incentives, which risk crowding out employees' intrinsic motivation. Among the variety of awards, two general types can be distinguished: confirmatory awards based on explicit, pre-determined performance criteria, and discretionary awards, which rely on broad performance evaluations and may be used ex post to honor outstanding performance. Appropriately designed and adjusted to the specific firm's characteristics, awards enhance employees' motivation and corporate performance. They express recognition and support their recipients' perceived competence and social status. Awards help to retain valuable employees and to establish role models. However, awards may also backfire, for instance, when they provoke envy among coworkers. We propose when awards risk destroying value and when they are particularly useful.},

A puzzle, however, is that an economic shock increases environmental uncertainty and therefore the risk associated with growth reconfiguration. This study finds that growth reduced performance and increased the risk of firm failure during the Asian economic shock of 1997. Growing firms differed in the extent to which they were able to mitigate the constraints imposed by the shock. However, the presence of developed external institutions played a more systematic role in their adaptation than did organizational resources represented by financial slack or product diversification. The deliberate attempt to reconfigure augmented the adverse effect of the economic shock on firm performance and survival. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm and human capital theory, we predict that executives will move between units with similar ‘structural composition' — a characteristic representing unit origin (as acquired or internally developed) and how the unit was reconfigured. We further argue that executives will be conduits of organizational change. We predict that units receiving more transferred executives, executives with recombination experience, and executives from core internal units will have a greater likelihood of being recombined, while units receiving executives from previously acquired units will tend to remain unchanged.

  abstract        = {Research summary: When faced with a new technological paradigm, incumbent firms can opt for internal development and/or external sourcing to obtain the necessary new knowledge. We explain how the effectiveness of external knowledge sourcing depends on the properties of internal knowledge production. We apply a social network lens to delineate interpersonal, intra-firm knowledge networks and capture the emergence of two important firm-level properties: the incumbent's internal potential for knowledge recombination and the level of knowledge coordination costs. We rely on firm-level internal knowledge networks to dynamically track the emergence of these properties across 106 global pharmaceutical companies over a 25-year time period. We find that a firm's success in developing knowledge in a new technological paradigm using external knowledge sourcing is contingent on these internal knowledge properties. Managerial summary: Incumbent firms in high-tech industries often face competence-destroying technological change. In their effort to adapt and develop new knowledge in a novel paradigm, incumbent firms have several corporate strategy options available to them: internal knowledge development and a wide array of external knowledge sourcing strategies, including alliances and acquisitions. In this study, we make an effort to address a critical question: How effective is external knowledge sourcing under different internal knowledge generation regimes? We find that external sourcing strategies are less effective when firms can already internally generate new knowledge or if they have high internal coordination costs. Therefore, when considering external sourcing, managers must carefully weigh the benefits of it vis-{\`{a}}-vis its commensurate costs as the benefits of external sourcing may be overstated.
