\begin{abstract}
  Empirical strategies leveraging exogenous shocks have substantial value, but
  they can be challenging to design and evaluate. One of the main reasons — at
  least in leadership and management — is the variance in how scholars think and
  use exogenous shocks. This work has a twofold objective. First, it aims to
  clarify the boundaries and nature of the exogenous shock concept. Second, it
  aspires to create a taxonomy that illuminates the attributes differentiating
  exogenous shocks and helps authors and reviewers to appreciate how empirical
  strategy issues vary across types of exogenous shock.

\section{\capitalisewords{Introduction}}
\label{sec:introduction}

%% hook
\noindent Exogenous shocks have started to play an increasingly central role in
the agenda of leadership and management researchers. On the one hand, the
Covid-19 pandemic has called attention to the consequences of major
environmental shifts for organizations \autocite{kniffin_et_al_2021} and markets
\autocite{zhang_et_al_2020}.  On the other hand, the ecological favor towards
causal evidence has further stressed that exogenous shocks are an integral part
of `smart' empirical strategies \autocite{angrist_2022}.\footnote{An empirical
strategy is a consistent configuration encompassing three elements: (i)
empirical identification; (ii) data; and (iii) statistical estimator. Exogenous
shocks influence (i) and (ii) and tend to associate with certain estimators,
such as Difference-in-Difference or Abadie's Synthetic Control Method.}

% scope of our work
Our work elaborates on two analytically distinct but interrelated observations.
First, the extant literature conveys different views on exogenous
shocks. Second, such a diversity of views appears to jeopardize the evaluation of
empirical strategies drawing on exogenous shocks.  Hence, we raise the following
research questions: \textit{What is an exogenous shock? How can we harness
exogenous shocks to achieve valid empirical strategies?}  

% what we do 
To address the first research question, we highlight the angle of the
`natural experimentalist' --- say Nobel laureate Professor Joshua Angrist --- 
according to which exogenous shocks are vital sources of randomization to carry
out causal inference with observational data.  Then, we conduct a
review of the literature that uncovers the diverse views of leadership and
management scholars on exogenous shocks. 

We address the second research question by proposing an original taxonomy of
exogenous shocks that expands on three elements: (i) the extent of the
intervention\footnote{Throughout the various sections of the document,
we will use the terms intervention and treatment interchangeably.} emerging  
from an exogenous shock, which ranges between one or few units and the totality
of a population's units; (ii) the timescale of the intervention, namely, 
the amount of time necessary for an exogenous shock to become relevant 
\textit{vis \'a vis} the research question at hand; (iii) the granularity 
of the intervention, which can either split the units into a control and a 
treatment groups or affect units with different degrees or intensity. 
We posit that specific combinations of these elements reveal types 
of exogenous shocks that present particular challenges in terms of 
empirical strategy.

% contribution
Our work provides a twofold contribution. We clarify the concept of exogenous
shock by considering its ontological status.  Our point is that exogenous shocks
are unobservable. In other words, they `exist' in the nexus of 
naturally-occurring events (e.g., the sudden death of an executive) and 
`concrete' theoretical or empirical problems (e.g., do social connections affect
an executive team's decision quality?).  We also help authors and reviewers
appreciate an exogenous shock's key features and reason about how these features
might threaten the validity of an empirical strategy aiming at inferring causal
effects with observational data.

Section \ref{sec:what_exogenous_shocks} succinctly illustrates how exogenous 
shocks are conceptualized and used in natural experiments and leadership and management
literature.  Section \ref{sec:how_exogenous_shocks_differ} introduces our novel
taxonomy of exogenous shocks.  Section \ref{sec:harnessing_exogenous_shocks}
describes how one can use our taxonomy to harness exogenous shocks. Finally,
section \ref{sec:coda} wraps up around the major points we raise and suggests
further methodological research avenues regarding the role of exogenous shocks
in leadership and management research.

\section{\capitalisewords{What is an exogenous shock?}}
\label{sec:what_exogenous_shocks}

\subsection{Exogenous shocks in the literature on natural experiments}
\label{subsec:exogenous_shocks_and_ne}

\noindent The literature on natural experiments offers several elements to
appreciate the concept of `exogenous shock' (\cite[for an overview
of the natural experiment design, see for example][]{withers_li_2021,
dunning_2012,craig_et_al_2017,keele_et_al_2016}; \cite[for a review of the
application of this design, see][]{sekhon_titiunik_2012,sieweke_santoni_2020,
roseinzweig_et_al_2000}). Mainly, the extant studies draw a line between the categories of
`exogenous shock' and `naturally-occurring event.' While one can observe
events such as diplomatic crises, institutional reforms, or terrorist attacks,
exogenous shocks are situated in abstract models that illustrate how economic
and social formations work in the real world \autocite{morgan_2012}. In other
words, impactful naturally-occurring events, such as the Covid-19 
pandemic, could be challenging to fit within a model of interest and, therefore,
do not lead to any exogenous shock. At the same time, a particular event could
provide multiple models with an exogenous shock.  For example, the reunification
of Eastern Germany and Western Germany has been exploited to address diverse
research questions, including the impact of income on health
\autocite[e.g.,][]{frijters_et_al_2004}, the transmission of preferences for
entrepreneurship from parents to children \autocite[e.g.,][]{wyrwich_2015}, or
the legitimation of inequality \autocite[e.g.,][]{haack_sieweke_2018}.

Figure \ref{fig:event_rq_mapping} pictorially depicts the idea that exogenous 
shocks emerge from purposive associations of naturally-occurring events
and research questions. The quality of these associations can be substantive 
--- when the environmental variation becomes an integral part of a study's 
theorizing ---, empirical --- if one exploits the environmental variation to deal with
endogeneity concerns --- or entail a combination of substantive and
empirical considerations.

\end{figure}

\vspace{2em}

%% substantive relevance
The lack of \textit{substantive relevance} is one of the most common `terrains' 
where scholars have criticized the use of naturally-occurring events as sources 
of randomization. For instance, in his critical analysis of Instrumental
Variable (IV) applications, \footnote{It is commonly accepted that natural
experiments comprise the `Instrumental Variable' design along with the `Standard
Natural Experiment' and `Regression Discontinuity Design'
\autocite{sieweke_santoni_2020,dunning_2012}.} Deaton \autocite*{deaton_2009}
observes that

\begin{quote}
\textit{
  ``[omitted] randomized evaluations of projects are useful for obtaining a
  convincing estimate of the average effect of a program or project. The price
  for this success is a focus that is too narrow to tell us `what works' in
  development, to design policy, or to advance scientific knowledge about
  development processes.''
  }
  (page 3)
\end{quote}

Hence, he argues

\begin{quote}
   \textit{
  ``[omitted] the analysis of programs or project needs to be refocused towards
  the investigation of potentially generalizable mechanisms that explain why and
  in what contexts projects can be expected to work. The best of the
  experimental work in development economics already does so, because its
  practitioners are too talented to be bound by their own methodological
  prescriptions. Yet there would be much to be said for doing so more openly. I
  concur with the general message in Pawson and Tilley (1997), who argue that
  thirty years of project evaluation in sociology, education and criminology was
  largely unsuccessful because it focused on whether projects work instead of on
  why they work.''
  }
  (page 4)
\end{quote}

Coming from an econometric background, Heckaman and Urzua
\autocite*{heckman_urzua_2010} share Deaton's concerns about the IV design as a
lever to approximate the experimental ideal

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``The problem that plagues the IV approach is that the questions it answers
  are usually defined as probability limits of estimators and not by
  well-formulated economic problems. Unspecified `effects' replace clearly
  defined economic parameters as the objects of empirical interest.''
  }
  (page 28)
\end{quote}

In his comprehensive work on natural experiments, Dunning 
\autocite*{dunning_2012} pragmatically points out

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``[omitted] the causes that Nature deigns to assign at random may not always
  be the most important causal variables for social scientists. For some
  observers, the proliferation of natural experiments therefore implies the
  narrowing of research agendas to focus on substantively uninteresting or
  theoretically irrelevant topics.''
  }
  (page 3)
\end{quote}

A positive example showing how to turn a naturally-occurring event into a shock
with substantive relevance is Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti's
\autocite*{miguel_et_al_2004} study of the effect of economic growth on civil
wars in Africa. Thanks to the ingenious choice to consider rainfall data, the
authors broaden the conversation on institutions and economic growth.
Particularly, the variation in rainfall levels facilitates an IV design that  
copes with longstanding endogeneity issues regarding the co-evolution of
institutions and macroeconomic factors. Hence, the authors can empirically
investigate a new and essential theoretical relationship, namely, the effect of
economic growth on the likelihood of civil war. 

%% potential outcome framework
Regarding the \textit{empirical relevance} of a naturally-occurring event, the
literature on natural experiments shows a strict view: an event qualifies as an
exogenous shock if and only if it allows to operate an empirical strategy with a
control group \autocite[][]{cook_et_al_2002}. In other words, there should be an
adequate time window\footnote{We discuss the temporal aspects of exogeneous
shocks' effects in Section \ref{sec:how_exogenous_shocks_differ} and Section
\ref{sec:harnessing_exogenous_shocks}.} in which the intervention $T$ emerging
from the exogenous shock affects a fraction of a population's units only.  Such
a condition is the \textit{sine qua non} to evaluate the impact of the
intervention using Neyman's potential outcome framework
\autocite*{neyman_et_al_1923}, an unbiased estimator of the average causal
effect $T - C$ that is based on three quantities: (1) $\widehat{T}$, the average
response if all subjects were assigned to treatment; (2) $\widehat{C}$, the
average response if all subjects were assigned to control; and (3) the
difference $\hat{T} - \widehat{C}$.

The study of John Snow of London's cholera outbreak of 1853-54\footnote{The
project of Snow --- aiming to prove that cholera did not transmit through the
air, the so called `miasma hypothesis'--- developed along two arms: he used
geospatial visualizations to show that attacks clustered around Broad Street
water pump in London's Soho district; then, he conducted the standard natural
experiment briefly summarized that we briefly summarize in the main text.}
emphasizes the importance of using exogenous shocks that heterogeneously affect
the units of a population. In 1852, the Lambeth Waterworks company --- one of
the major utility companies supplying water to several parts of the city ---
relocated their waterworks from Hungerford Market to fifteen miles upstream in
the Thames, thereby \textit{``obtaining a supply of water quite free from the
sewage of London''} \autocite[][page 68]{snow_1855}. Contrarily, Southwark \&
Vauxhall, a company competing with Lambeth Waterworks in several districts of
London, left its intake pipe downstream in the Thames at Battersea. Snow
obtained records on cholera deaths in households throughout London, as well as
information on the company that provided water to each household and the total
number of houses served by each company. Figure
\ref{fig:snow_natural_experiment} reports one of the most compelling pieces of
empirical evidence included the study: fatal attacks are compared before and
after the exogenous shock --- namely, Lambeth Waterworks moving their intake pipelines in
1952 --- and by water supply (see the column reported on the far-right hand section
of the table). Consistently with Neyman's model, the analyses of Snow
disentangle the `true' effect of the exogenous shock on cholera communication from
time-invariant attributes regarding the households served by different water
suppliers, and, perhaps more importantly, from the time-variant factors such as
the state of the cholera outbreak at other points in time. Should the
naturally-occurring event have affected the totality of households in London,
unlikely Snow's work would have addressed the problem of confounders
convincingly.

    datapoints (Lambeth Waterworks moved their intake pipes in 1952) for 
    treated and control households.}

  \end{small}
\end{figure}

%% sudden? out of control?
A related but distinct aspect of \textit{empirical relevance} concerns the
`exogenous' nature of the naturally-occurring variation. The literature on
natural experiments emphasizes that relevant events are not necessarily sudden,
such as the death of a business leader because of heart attack
\autocite[e.g.,][]{nguyen_et_al_2010},\footnote{The identification of sudden
deaths poses definition issues
\autocite[e.g.,][]{azoulay_et_al_2010,oettl_2012}.  In the interest of
consistency, Nguyen and Nielsen \autocite*{nguyen_et_al_2010} report they
\textit{``rely on the medical literature, which defines sudden death as an
unexpected and non-traumatic death that occurs instantaneously or within a few
hours of an abrupt change in the person’s previous clinical state.''} The causes
of sudden deaths they consider are `hearth attack,' `stroke,' and `accident or
murder.' In addition to such deaths, they consider also \textit{``accidental and
traumatic deaths that are unanticipated by the stock market and unrelated to
firm conditions''} (page 553). } uncontrollable, such as earthquakes
\autocite[e.g.,][]{belloc_et_al_2016}, or random, such as lotteries
\autocite[e.g.,][]{poulos_2019}. The extant studies show that legal changes and
policy interventions can be purposefully used as exogenous shocks to address
particular research questions \autocites[e.g.,][]{beaman_et_al_2012,
matsa_miller_2013,chauchard_2014}. Dunning \autocite*[][page 236]{dunning_2012}
advances a three-step procedure to assess whether a naturally-occurring event
can be plausibly considered exogenous or `as-if random'. First, researchers
should investigate whether units had information that they would or would not
receive the treatment. Second, researchers need to check whether units had
incentives to self-select into the treatment group or control group. Third,
researchers should analyze whether not only units had incentives but also the
capacity to self-select into a treatment status. For the assessment, Dunning
\autocite*{dunning_2012} suggests using both qualitative evidence (e.g.,
documents, interviews) and quantitative evidence (e.g., balance tests).

For example, Snow \autocite*{snow_1855} presented various sorts of evidence to
establish the pre-treatment equivalence of the houses that were exposed to pure
and contaminated sources of water supply

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``The mixing of the (water) supply is of the most intimate kind. The pipes of
  each Company go down all the streets, and into nearly all the courts and
  alleys. A few houses are supplied by one Company and a few by the other,
  according to the decision of the owner or occupier at that time when the Water
  Companies were in active competition. In many cases a single house has a
  supply different from that on either side. Each company supplies both rich and
  poor, both large houses and small; there is no difference either in the
  condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different
  Companies\ldots It is obvious that no experiment could have been devised which
  would more thoroughly test the effect of water supply on the progress of
  cholera than this.''
  }
  \autocite[][pages 74 - 75]{snow_1855}
\end{quote}

At the same time, qualitative information on the context and the process that
determined the source of water-supply source was also essential for Snow.  For
instance, he emphasized that absentee landlords decided which competing water
companies would have served a particular address.  Thus, many residents had
limited opportunities to `self-select' into a source of water supply --- thus,
confounding characteristics of residents appeared unlikely to explain the large
differences in death rates by company (see Figure
\ref{fig:snow_natural_experiment}).  Moreover,  the Lambeth company committed to
moving their intake pipe upstream on the Thames before the cholera outbreak of
1853–54, when existing scientific knowledge did not link water sources to
cholera risk.  Such a supply choice implied that more than 300,000 people of all
ages and social strata were

\begin{quote}
  \textit{``divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, 
  without their knowledge; one group being supplied with water containing the 
  sewage of London, and, amongst it, whatever might have come from the cholera 
  patients, the other group having water quite free from such impurity.''}
  \autocite[][pages 74–75]{snow_1855}

Drawing on the methodological insights included in Snow's study, 
Figure~\ref{fig:ex_shocks_and_ne} visually illustrates the idea that both
events that are unknown/unknowable to units and events that are known to units
can provide scholars with an exogenous variation suited to address the research
question at hand.  However, `known events' may raise endogeneity concerns
regarding the possibility of a unit affecting the direction and magnitude of a
naturally-occurring variation and self-select into the treatment or control
group.

\subsection{Exogenous shocks in leadership and management research}
\label{subsec:exogenous_shocks_in_management}

\noindent To understand how leadership and management scholars conceptualize and
use exogenous shocks, we conducted a review of the literature.  Specifically, we
focused on the studies that assign the concept of exogenous shock to a core 
narrative role by placing it in the paper's title or abstract.\footnote{ Our
purpose is not to provide a systematic review of the literature on the role of
exogenous shocks for empirical identification (see \cite{sieweke_santoni_2020}).
Rather, we aim to uncover the views and uses of the exogenous shock concept. 
Retrieving the studies in which the bigram `exogenous shock' appears once or 
a few times in the full text of the paper would have little value for us.}
Consistently with recently published reviews 
\autocite[e.g.,][]{gonzalez_et_al_2018,rindova_et_al_2018}, we restricted our
search to a selection of prominent journals such as Academy of Management
Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice,
Journal of Applied Psychology, Journal of Business Ethics, Journal of Business
Venturing, Journal of Management, Journal of Management Studies, The Leadership
Quarterly, Management Science, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision
Processes, Organization Science, Organization Studies, Personnel Psychology,
Research Policy, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, Strategic Management
Journal, Strategic Organization.  Using Scopus, we retrieved 58 articles
published up until or in press on December 22, 2021 presenting the bi-gram
`exogenous shock*,' in the title, abstract, \emph{or} set of author's generated
keywords.

Having considered the full manuscript of each retrieved articles, we discarded
18 articles that did not fall within the reviews's remit. Particularly, 
we excluded from the sample two studies in which the search token appears once
and 
appears not to focus on or use the conceptual category of `exogenous shock'
\autocite{uzzi199735,kriauciunas2006659}; one work focusing on managers'
cognitive representation of a shock \autocite{barreto2013687}; four
non-empirical papers
\autocite[e.g.,][]{mcsweeney2009933}; two qualitative studies
\autocite{glynn20051031, jenkins2010884}; one field experiment 
\autocite{cui20191216}; eleven Management Science articles dealing with 
finance, marketing, or operations subjects \autocite[e.g.,][]{tham20182901}.
Figure~\ref{fig:studies_across_journals} illustrates the distribution of sample
studies across journals.

\end{figure}         

\vspace{2em}

The two authors independently coded the retained studies against the dimensions 
included in Figure \ref{fig:event_rq_mapping},that is, (1) the exploited 
naturally-occurring event (e.g., 9/11, Sarbane-Oxley Act); (2) the leading
research question (e.g., `how do changes in an employee's relational capital
influence mobility and entrepreneurship decisions?'); and (3) the relationship
between (1) and (2), which can be substantive --- when the exogenous shock is an
integral part of the research question/plays a key role for theorizing 
--- or empirical --- when a study's authors claim to leverage a
naturally-occurring event to cope with the problem of confounders --- or both.
Having completed the independent analysis of sample studies, the two authors of
this work merged their coding choices and reconciled their different views
regarding the role of exogenous shocks in four papers.\footnote{The coding
spreadsheet is publicly available at: \href{
https://www.dropbox.com/s/yl0sf9p9tq253fy/coded_studies.csv?dl=0}
{https://www.dropbox.com/.../coded\_studies.xlsx?dl=0}.} Table
\ref{tab:summary_of_studies} reports the outcome of our coding, including a
summary of how the naturally-occurring event qualifies as an exogenous shock
(see the column `Summary,' reported on the right-hand side of the table).

Regarding the first dimension of our coding, the most popular categories of 
events are `legal change' (N = 12) and `turnover' (N = 7) (see Figure 
\ref{fig:classes_of_events}). Concerning `legal change,' scholars have relied on
events such as the staggered passage of anti-takeover laws 
\autocite{cabral202128,wang20162393}, change in immigration rules 
\autocite{choudhury2019203}, the Garn-St. Germain Act \autocite{haveman2001253},
the Sarbane-Oxley Act \autocite{gupta2020802}, SEC's regulation change
\autocite{jia2020290}, the change of inheritance, gift, and estate taxes
\autocite{kang20201300}, the staggered adoption of the Inevitable Disclosure
Doctrine in U.S. \autocite{kang20201300}, a revision of U.S. Higher Education
Amendments \autocite{krishnan20194522}, reductions in import tariffs
\autocite{li20194011}, demonetization measures \autocite{natarajan20191070}.
Turnover events comprise sick leave episodes of key employees
\autocite{chen20181239,drexler20142722,chown2015177,}, political leadership
churn \autocite{birhanu2020,byun20191368}, and executives' sudden death 
\autocite{ke2019439,he20221512} and retirement \autocite{he20221512}. Other recurrent events include terrorist attacks
\autocite{corbo2016323,vergne20121027,li20194011,bastardoz2022}, scandals
\autocite{cai2019159,hilary2021}, change in financial analysts' coverage
\autocite{chatterji2010917,qian20192271}, and pandemics 
\autocite{garretsen2022,jo20211267}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering

    exogenous shock. Notes. --- N = 37.}
    \label{fig:classes_of_events}
\end{figure}

\vspace{2em}

As shown in the Venn diagram in Figure \ref{fig:event_roles}, circa three
cases out of four (N = 27) claim to use exogenous shocks with
an empirical role. For instance, Krishnan and Wang \autocite*{krishnan20194522}
use Survey of Consumer Finances data to address the research question `does
student debt influence the propensity to start a firm?'  The concept of
exogenous shock is not essential for the scope of their work and does not inform
the proposed theorizing. Still, one may study the relationship
between student debt and business creation using a correlational approach.
However, the authors are concerned about the causal
interpretation of their empirical estimates

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``there may be unobserved characteristics that may drive our results. For
  instance, individuals with wealthier families may have lower student debt as
  well as the financial means to start a firm. Such unobservable family effects
  may explain the negative relation between student debt and entrepreneurship.
  Alternatively, individuals from wealthier families may borrow more if they
  expect to be able to pay back the loans easily (and such individuals are more
  likely to be entrepreneurs).''
  }
  (page 4528)
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \import{}{exhibits/event_roles.pgf}
    \caption{Role of the naturally-occurring events presumed to create
    an exogenous shock.}
    \label{fig:event_roles}
\end{figure}

Hence, they use a legal change as an exogenous shock to the cost of business 
failures for individuals with greater levels of student loans

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``To address endogeneity concerns, we utilize the Higher Education Amendments
  (HEA) of 1998, which effectively rendered student loans completely
  non-dischargeable. We find that students that were already in four-year
  college at the time of this regulation and had significant student debt were
  less likely to start a firm. This test considers only individuals who were
  enrolled prior to the year of regulation (i.e., prior to 1998) in a four-year
  college.  The idea is that, for the group of individuals who are already
  enrolled in college, the regulatory change is clearly exogenous, in the sense
  that it does not drive their choice to enter college. ''
  }
  (page 4532)
\end{quote}

About half of the studies (N = 20) assign a substantive role to exogenous
shocks.  For example, Haveman, Russo, and Meyer \autocite*{haveman2001253} 
articulate a framework that links organizations' responses to discontinuous
industry-level regulatory change. The theoretical section of the study maps the
phenomenon of regulatory change onto the General Punctuated Equilibrium Model
and provides expectations about the multiple consequences of regulatory change
for individual organizations. The substantive role of the shock is self-evident
in the formulation of the hypotheses, e.g.

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Immediately following any regulatory punctuation, CEO succession rates
    will not rise; instead, CEO succession rates will rise gradually as time
    passes.''
  }
  (page 259)
\end{quote}

It is worth notice the authors emphasize the `exogenous' nature of the Garn-St.
Germain Act --- the example of regulatory change at the center of the paper 
---, but they do not discuss what it means for the study's empirical strategy, 
especially in terms of empirical identification.

We also found that one study out of four (N = 10) claims to use an exogenous with
empirical and substantive relevance. Byun, Raffaele, and Ganco
\autocite{byun20191368} propose a hypothesis set that connects `discontinuous
increases in the value of an employee's relational capital' with `employee
turnover' and `spinout' formation. For example, their first hypothesis states

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Discontinuous increases in the value of an  employee's relational capital
    will be positively related to employee exit.''
  }
  (page 1371)
\end{quote}

The authors can advance and test this and the other hypotheses thanks to
naturally-occurring events regarding the politicians connected to lobbyists
(i.e., `employees').  Here is the passage from the paper describing the
independent variable of the study, `discontinuous increases in the value of an
employee's relational capital'

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``We use appointments to committee chair and assignments to the four most
    powerful committees in Congress to capture connected politicians' power
    changes in the legislative process. Discontinuous increase is a binary
    variable coded `1' for the first year a politician connected to a lobbyist
    is selected to be a chair of a congressional committee or is assigned to one
    of the powerful committees in Congress and `0' otherwise.''
  }
  (page 1375)
\end{quote}

The series of political appointment decisions also play an empirical role, the 
Byun and colleagues point out

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Our identifying assumption is consistent with prior work and rests on the
    notion that the temporal change in power of connected politicians is
    exogenous, conditional on the observable characteristics of the lobbyists
    and their firms [omitted]. For the power change of a connected politician to
    be plausibly exogenous, whether and when the connected politician will
    experience the advancement has to be difficult to predict by lobbyists and
    firms. In addition, the change in lobbyist's value creation due to a surge
    in the value of political connections should be uncorrelated with the
    accumulation of the lobbyist's expertise, conditional on observables. Given
    the complicated and uncertain political process of chair selection and
    committee assignment, scholars have argued that committee and chair
    assignment satisfies these conditions with respect to lobbyists [omitted].
    In fact, others have gone as far as to argue that the timing and ascension
    of committee and chair appointments are exogenous even to the politician
    herself [omitted]. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that using the power
    change of a connected politician to capture discontinuous increases in the
    lobbyist's relational capital would alleviate identification concerns due to
    potential omitted variable biases.''

    }
    \label{fig:potential_outcome}
  \end{small}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:potential_outcome} illustrates the distribution of sample
studies across empirical strategies and exogenous shocks' roles. One article out
of three (N = 14) operates an empirical strategy without a control group.
Within this group, we found six articles that do not use the shock for
empirical identification purposes. For example, Corbo, Ferriani, and Corrado
\autocite*{corbo2016323} use 9/11 as a \textit{``major environmental shock''}
(page 323), affecting the logic that shapes the formation of alliances in the
airline industry. The impact of 9/11 on aviation companies is so immediate and
pervasive to impede the identification of units that can form a control group
even for a limited timespan.  Although such a naturally-occurring variation does
not help the authors in terms of empirical identification, it is relevant from a
substantive standpoint. According to Corbo and his colleagues, 9/11 allows to explore
novel theoretical intuitions regarding the change of interorganizational
networks

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Our intuition is that patterns of interorganizational network ties provide
    a lens through which to view critical junctures that question extant logics
    and open prospects for change, enabling us to shed light on organizational
    responses to external events.  To explore these ideas empirically and inform
    our understanding of the interorganizational dynamics characterizing fields
    that undergo cataclysmic upheavals, we focus on the global airline industry
    in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (henceforth
    9/11), which caused one of the most severe crises ever experienced by civil
    aviation worldwide. Given the exploratory, theory-building nature of the
    study we employ a hybrid empirical strategy that combines qualitative data
    analysis with quantitative social network analysis, enabling us to capture a
    more complete, holistic and contextual portrayal of the units under study
    [omitted].''
  }
  (page 325)
\end{quote}

The remaining eight articles lacking a control group emphasize the empirical
relevance of their naturally-occurring events. Seebeck and Vetter
\autocite*{seebeck2021} investigate the relationship between gender board
diversity and corporate risk disclosure.  The study uses the Brexit Referendum
to create an intention-to-treat model \autocite{angrist_1996} where the future
exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union is an exogenous shock on
firm's risk environment by which

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``all firms face similar and tremendous risks related to the Brexit that
    need to be considered by public firms when preparing their annual reports
    according to the Financial Reporting Council (FRC 2016a, b) as well as
    section 414c(2)(b) of the companies act and section 4 of the UK corporate
    governance code.''
  }
  (page 396)
\end{quote}

The authors claim to advance the literature on gender diversity and 
corporate governance by dealing with the endogeneity of a firm's risk 
reporting needs. Specifically, they assert their empirical strategy

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``is less likely to face the risk of omitted variables, allowing to provide
    more reliable evidence of an association between board gender diversity and
    corporate risk disclosure.''
  }
  (page 396)
\end{quote}

However, Seebeck and Vetter's article does not rely on Neyman Potential
Outcome Framework because the study sample includes UK (FTSE 350) companies
only, which are all affected by the exogenous shock associated with the Brexit 
referendum. 

Similar to Seebeck and Vetter's work, the study of Bastardotz, Jacquart and 
Antonakis \autocite*{bastardoz2022} uses a naturally-occurring event with 
immediate and pervasive consequences on organizational and social formations. 
Specifically, the study considers 9/11  and the 2015 and 2016 terrorist 
attacks in France as exogenous shocks to assess the causal effect of crises 
on political leaders' charismatic rhetoric. To cope with the lack of a ground-truth 
control group --- i.e., cross-sectional variance in the treatment across units 
---  Bastardoz and colleagues use the Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT) estimator 
\autocite{hausman_rapson_2018}, which they present as a model that

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``closely resembles event-studies or interrupted time series
    analyses in that they examine the effect of exogenous events on
    individual or organizational decisions. For instance, a researcher
    may be interested in studying how impromptu events such as the
    eruption of a Volcano or a ship being stuck in the Suez Canal affect
    global supply chains. Using time as a selection mechanism, researchers 
    could estimate the effect of such events by considering the outcome of 
    interest just before and just after the event, assuming the
    event is exogenous (i.e., unexpected).''
  }
  (page 2)
\end{quote}

To attenuate the concern that the units (that is, political leaders' speeches)
differ across the sides of the cutoff for reasons other than the exogenous shock,
the authors perform a sensitivity analysis by re-estimating their RDiT model

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    `` using only half of the time window on each side of the cutoff,
    concentrating only on observations closest to the discontinuity. This
    reduced sample includes only 20 speeches pre-crisis (29 passages)
    and 18 speeches post-crisis (33 passages), ranging from 117 days
    before to 90 days after the 9/11 events. This reduced sample provided
    similar estimates of the treatment effect compared to the full sample 
    [omitted]''

\section{\capitalisewords{How do exogenous shocks differ?}}
\label{sec:how_exogenous_shocks_differ}

\noindent This section of the study introduces a taxonomy of exogenous shocks
that help scholars evaluate a concrete shock's essential features and link them
with salient empirical strategy challenges. In so doing, we take the relevance
of a naturally-occurring event `for granted.' In other words, we assume the
authors have already proven the added value of the environmental variation to
addressing a target research question.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy}, the taxonomy is based on three dimensions
of exogenous shocks: (1) the \textit{extent of the intervention}, i.e., the 
fraction of a unit's population that are presumed to be treated; (2) the
\textit{the timescale of the intervention}, i.e., the amount of time an
exogenous shock takes to treat units; (3) the \textit{granularity of the 
intervention}, i.e., the different degrees with which an exogenous shock treats
units.

The literature shows considerable variations regarding the first dimension, an 
\textit{exogenous shock's extent of intervention}. At one extreme of
the gamut, there are cases such as pilot or unique policies and rare
naturalistic or social events that affect one unit only.  For instance,  Nathan
\autocite*{nathan_2020} evaluates the causal impact of a flagship UK technology
cluster program that carries out an original `light-touch,' market-oriented
intervention. The policy under investigation --- which the author presents in
as an as-if random variation\footnote{Here is a passage from Nathan 
\autocite*{nathan_2020} where the author describes the empirical identification
strategy for the paper: \textit{``By 2010 Ministers were claiming
`something special' for the Inner East London cluster (Cameron, 2010; Osborne
and Schmidt, 2012). Other accounts depict policy origins as chaotic (Butcher,
2013; Nathan et al., 2019), and thus as good as random''} (page 5).} --- 
regards one cluster London solely (that is, `Tech City'). The study of Abadie 
and Gardeazabal \autocite*{abadie_gardeazabal_2003} is another example 
of an exogenous shock affecting one unit only. The authors use the terrorist 
conflict in the Basque Country as a case study to investigate the 
effect of conflict on regional GDP.

In other circumstances, exogenous shocks regard a fraction of the units included
in the reference population. Typical cases are empirical strategies that
consider the death of business or political leaders
\autocite[e.g.,][]{iyer_2010,bennedsen_et_al_2007,
nguyen_et_al_2010,nguyen_et_al_2014,johnson_et_al_1985,
lee_et_al_2020,ke2019439,kang20201300,jones_olken_2005,quigley_et_al_2017,
brown_et_al_2017}.  For instance, Iyer \autocite*{iyer_2010} uses the heirless
death of princes in the $19^{th}$ as a random variate accounting for the
transition of a district from the `indirect rule' to the `direct rule,' in which
British administrators collected taxes and administered local governance
themselves. The descriptive evidence reported in Iyer's work indicates twenty
districts out of 181 experience the heirless death.\footnote{Iyer considers the
twelve year timespan (1848 - 1856) where the Governor-General of India, Lord
Dalhousie, enacted a new policy Doctrine of Lapse, annexation would result from
the death of a ruler without a natural heir.} One of the studies included in our
systematic review of the literature \autocite{jia2020290} takes advantage of
SEC's pilot study consisting in exclusion of designated securities from the
operation of the `tick' test of Rule 10a-1(a) and any short sale price test rule
of any exchange or national securities association. Such a temporary
intervention resulted in a stock price risk surge for 512 firms belonging to the
Russell 3000 Index.

The other extreme of the gamut regards exogenous shocks that interest the whole
population of units. That could happen for different reasons. Sometimes,
governments introduce legal changes in a non-staggered manner, making new laws
binding at the same point in time for all firms located in the country.  An
example is Norway's gender quota policy, the shock central to the work of Matsa
and Miller \autocite*{matsa_miller_2013} on the implications of gender
composition in executive teams. Norwegian public limited companies had two years to comply
with the requirement of having at least 40 percent representation from each sex
on their board. According to the descriptive evidence reported in the study,
\textit{``nearly all firms complied by February 2008, and all did by April
2008''} (page 140). Exogenous shocks that affect the entire population of
reference can also emerge from events such as major catastrophes, pandemics,
recessions, or global-scale terrorist attacks. Examples are Corbo et al.
\autocite*{corbo2016323} and Vergne \autocite*{vergne20121027},
--- which rely on the variance created by 9/11 to investigate the change
of the airline industry and the boundaries of the global arm sector respectively
--- and Gupta et al. \autocite*{gupta2020802}, which draws on the Global 
Financial Crisis as a source of pressures for CFOs to report favorable results,

The second dimension of our topology --- \textit{the timescale of the intervention} --- emphasizes
the timing with which an exogenous shock is presumed to affect a relationship or
mechanism of interest. To clarify this dimension, let us focus on one specific
class of exogenous shocks: the death of individuals occupying prominent
positions in organization or fields. The finance literature abounds of studies
using sudden deaths amongst upper echelons to address the overarching question
`how do executives matter?'
\autocites[e.g.,][]{johnson_et_al_1985,nguyen_et_al_2014,nguyen_et_al_2010,
faccio_parsley_2009,salas_2010,fracassi_tate_2012,fee_et_al_2013,cho_et_al_2016,
dedman_et_al_2002,duchin_sosyura_2013,falato_et_al_2014}.
The intuition behind this body of work is that analyst and market reactions
to unanticipated executive turnover reveal the `net contribution'
of business leaders to shareholder value. As Nguyen 
and colleagues \autocite*[][]{nguyen_et_al_2014} note, stock price changes 
play a critical role as they

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``reflect the expected incremental value of cash flows under the deceased
    executive net of this pay, relative to the expected incremental value of the
    replacement net of his pay.''
  }
  (page 3000)
\end{quote}

Since market expectations factor in broad arrays of time-variant elements (e.g.,
the search costs a firm may incur to fill the vacancy in), it is critically
important to pick up an appropriate time window within which stock prices foster
a \textit{ceteris paribus}, pre-post shock comparison. Nguyen and colleagues
\autocite*[][]{nguyen_et_al_2014} evaluate the impact of executives' sudden
death using 

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``daily returns from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) for
    an 11-trading-day period around the death. The event day is defined as the
    trading day of the executive's death, or the first trading day following
    the death if it occurred on a nontrading day.''
  }
  (page 3000)
\end{quote}

Such a strand of finance literature stresses two aspects. First, sudden
executive deaths are essential sources of variance to estimate leaders' economic
and financial impact.  Second, and more importantly for our taxonomy, there is a
relatively tight time-frame where executive sudden deaths create exogenous
shocks to address the question `how do executives matter?'

Studies across the fields of economics of science and sociology of science
highlight a different temporal pattern by which sudden deaths alter reference
processes or mechanisms and, in turn, acquire relevance. Several articles
\autocites[e.g.,][]{azoulay_et_al_2019_b,azoulay_et_al_2019_a,khanna_et_al_2021,
aizenam_kletzer_2011,azoulay_et_al_2010,oettl_2012} take advantage of the start
scientists' premature death to estimate better the spill-overs that emanate from
collaboration. The seminal study of Azoulay, Graff Zivin, and Wang 
\autocite*{azoulay_et_al_2010} quantifies these spill-overs in terms of a
scientist's differential of publications and research grants when collaborative
ties collapse because of the death of an alter star scientist. Different to the
finance literature, where executive deaths can create `instantaneous' change in
expectations about a firm's future cash flows, Azoulay et al.
\autocite*{azoulay_et_al_2010} consider a broad timespan to reveal the effect of
exogenous shock. The rationale seems twofold. On the one hand, spill-overs can
`roll over' after the death of a superstar collaborator.  On the other hand, a
scientist's research can take substantial time to change.  These elements seem
to guide the choice of the authors to evaluate the effects of the shock in a
fifteen-year time window (see Figure \ref{fig:azoulay_et_al_2010}). At the same
time, they also account for the intertemporal variation of the superstar
extinction effect

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Following the superstar's death, the treatment effect increases
    monotonically in absolute value, becoming statistically significant three to
    four years after death. Two aspects of this result are worthy of note.
    First, we find no evidence of recovery --- the effect of superstar
    extinction appears permanent. Though we will explore mechanisms in more
    detail below, this seems inconsistent with a bereavement-induced loss in
    productivity.  Second, the delayed onset of the effect makes sense because
    it plausibly takes some time to exhaust the productive potential of the
    star's last scientific insights. In addition, the typical NIH grant cycle is
    three to five years, and the impact of a superstar's absence may not really
    be felt until it becomes time to apply for a new grant.''
  }

    variables corresponding to eleven years before the year of death and prior,
    ten years before the year of death, nine years before the year of death,
    \ldots, fourteen years after the year of death, and fifteen years after the
    year of death and above (the indicator variable for treatment status
    interacted with the year of death is omitted).''}}
    \label{fig:azoulay_et_al_2010}
\end{figure}

The third element of our taxonomy regards the \textit{granularity of the 
intervention} that stems from the exogenous shock. The least granular 
intervention corresponds to a binary treatment that splits units into 
two experimental groups \textit{\'a la} Snow \autocite*{snow_1855}.
An intermediate level of granularity occurs when the exogenous shock 
is presumed to form more than two groups of units, each of which receives
a certain amount of treatment. For instance, the study included in our
review by Chen and Garg \autocite*{chen20181239} divides NBA teams into 
four strata: those not affected by a superstar injury (the control group) and 
those affected by a superstar injury implying `short,' `medium,' and `long' 
absence. Finally, an exogenous shock may create a continuous treatment. 
An example is  Drago and Galbiati's \autocite*{drago_galbiati_2012} paper
on social influence and criminal activity. The authors use the Collective 
Clemency Bill, the Italian Parliament approved in 2006, as an exogenous 
variation in the incentives to commit a crime:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Upon approval of the bill, almost 22,000 inmates were released from
    Italian prisons. Of direct importance to the objective of this study, the
    bill stipulates that if a former inmate commits another crime within 5 years
    of their release from prison, they will be required to serve the residual
    sentence suspended by the pardon (varying from 1 to 36 months) in addition
    to the sentence for the new crime. In other words, the policy effectively
    transforms one month of an original sentence into an additional one month of
    sentence for future crimes committed at the individual level.''
  }
  (page 200)
\end{quote}

For Drago and Galbiati \autocite*{drago_galbiati_2012}, the shock does not
originate from the new law. Instead, it comes from the interaction between the
application of the law  --- commuting actual sentences in expected sentences for 
forty percent of the Italian prison population --- and a prisoner's residual 
sentence at date of release. Thanks to such an ingenious empirical strategy, 
the authors can show

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Peers' residual sentences greatly impact individual recidivism. The
    estimated impact of the average residual sentence of the group (excluding
    the individual himself) is comparable to the direct effect of the individual
    residual sentence. In particular, an average residual sentence of one
    additional month decreases the probability of being rearrested by 0.16
    percentage points. The considerable size of the indirect effects is
    consistent with a social multiplier of two in crime.'' }

\section{\capitalisewords{Harnessing exogenous shocks: empirical strategy challenges}}
\label{sec:harnessing_exogenous_shocks}

\noindent This section emphasizes the empirical strategy challenges that are
more likely to arise across exogenous shocks with different features. Mainly, we
focus on three challenges: (1) the scope of applicability of Neyman's Potential
Outcome Framework; (2) the external validity of an average treatment effect; (3)
interference between treated and control units, i.e., SUTVA violations. To do
that, we map some ideal cases of exogenous shocks onto the taxonomy presented in
the previous section (see Figure \ref{fig:comparative_static}).

Let us consider case $A$, where a binary intervention influences a significant
number of units by altering meaningful empirical relationships or theoretical
mechanisms in a short amount of time. That would be the typical `finance paper'
drawing on the variance generated by the sudden death of executives. For
instance, Nguyen and colleagues' \autocite*{nguyen_et_al_2014} paper is based on
149 sudden death events whose effects are presumed to manifest in a relatively
short timespan (i.e., eleven days). Such a case poses minimal concerns in terms
of empirical strategy.  First, the population of units contains a sufficient
number of controls to approximate the unobservable counterfactual (e.g., how a
stock price would have evolved absent the unanticipated executive turnover).
Second, the binary intervention variable is `well-behaved' and does not create
range restriction issues threatening the external validity of the empirical
estimates.  Finally, the tight timescale of the intervention reduces the chances
that control units will be unintentionally treated or affected by treated units'
course of actions (that would be a vacancy chain at the executive level
involving both treated and control companies, which is unlikely in a timespan
such as the one Nguyen and colleagues \autocite*{nguyen_et_al_2014} consider).

\vspace{2em}

Case $A_{1}$ differs from $A$ because of the timescale of the intervention,
which has a temporally dilated impact on the empirical relationships and 
theoretical mechanisms at the center of the study. Azoulay and colleagues'
\autocite*{azoulay_et_al_2010} paper on `superstar extinction' and knowledge
spill-overs is consistent with this case. The author's dataset contains 112
sudden, premature ends of elite life scientists, whose effects on circa five
thousand collaborators are modeled empirically over a fifteen-year timespan
(see Figure \ref{fig:azoulay_et_al_2010}). Similarly to $A$, chances are
significant the population will contain suited control cases and external
validity concerns will be least. However, interference issues may arise because
of the persisting impact of the shock.  For instance, the effects of super-star
extinction events may propagate over time through the social structure of
collaboration affecting treated units' collaborators supposed
to belong to the control group. Azoulay et al.  \autocite*{azoulay_et_al_2010}
propose supplemental analysis to deal with possible SUTVA violations, they
present in terms of the \textit{``problem of leakage through the coauthorship
network''} (page 579).

In general, relying on an exogenous shock such as $B$ poses external validity 
concerns. Plausible causes are generic range restriction issues --- i.e., a
treatment group with a limited variance --- and/or the presence of treated units
showing idiosyncratic features. The former may appear in studies with few
treated units \autocite[e.g.,][]{aizenam_kletzer_2011}.  The latter is common
when naturally-occurring events regard complex systems such as regions/countries
\autocite[e.g.,][]{abadie_gardeazabal_2003}, business platforms
\autocite[e.g.,][]{zhang2020}, or industrial clusters 
\autocite[e.g.,][]{nathan_2020}. Insofar as the population contains comparable
control units, an empirical strategy can still produce causal evidence in such a
scenario. However, the estimated effect is a local average treatment effect
(LATE) \autocite{imbens_2009} since it \textit{``it only characterizes causal
parameters for particular units''} \autocite[][page 290]{dunning_2012}. A
`cautious,' LATE interpretation of empirical estimates is --- if possible ---
even more critical in case $B_{2}$, where the increased granularity in the
treatment may exacerbate range restriction issues.\footnote{The key idea is that
the distribution of study variables conditional on different level of the
treatment may present significant sparsity.} Alternatively, the treated unit
might lack a match in the control group. Then, `Abadie's Comparative Case'
method 
\autocite{abadie_gardeazabal_2003,abadie_2021,abadie_et_al_2010,abadie_et_al_2015} 
would be essential to create a synthetic counterfactual.\footnote{As
Abadie points out in his recent article \autocite*{abadie_2021}, the synthetic
case control method was originally proposed \textit{``with the aim to estimate
the effects of aggregate interventions, that is, interventions that are
implemented at an aggregate level affecting a small number of large units (such
as a cities, regions, or countries), on some aggregate outcome of interest''
(page 392).}}

Sometimes, a naturally-occurring event's attributes and role
\textit{vis \'a vis} the target research question impedes the identification of
a control group. In our review, some studies that take advantage of the variance
created by 9/11 for theorizing \autocite{corbo2016323} or measurement purposes
\autocite{vergne20121027}.  In contrast, none uses 9/11 to create an exogenous
shock study in the sense of a natural experiment. In other circumstances, the
existence of surrogate populations allows researchers to bypass the problem of a
total-spectrum exogenous shock. The gender quota study of Matsa and Miller 
\autocite*{matsa_miller_2013} is one of the most representative examples.  The
government of Norway applied the `40\% policy' in a non-staggered manner and
made it mandatory for all public companies. The authors bypass the lack of
counterfactuals by adjusting their empirical strategy in two ways. First, they
consider two surrogate populations, namely Norwegian private firms and public
firms located in Scandinavian countries ( textit{ex-ante}, similar to Norway in
terms of culture and institutions).  Second, they use a triple
Difference-in-Difference estimator to create a composite counterfactual that
considers factors specific to the Norwegian economy and factors specific to
comparable public companies. Compared with $C$, cases $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ pose
fewer constraints when identifying a control group. Under $C_{1}$, scholars can
exploit the cross-section  variance created by staggered policies. $C_{2}$ is
consistent with studies using the variance generated by global events that, at
least temporarily, have heterogeneous effects across regions or countries.
Presumably, this case could become increasingly popular in the future as
scholars use the Covid-19 pandemic as a source of variance in organizational
practices (e.g., work from home).

In Figure \ref{fig:harnessing_exogeneous_shocks}, we use a decision tree to 
summarize the intuitions presented in this section of the paper.

\section{Coda}
\label{sec:coda}

\noindent This paper aims to help authors and reviewers assess the validity of
empirical strategies based on exogenous shocks. In the first arm of this
project, we have clarified the exogenous shock concept's boundaries and
ontological status. Mainly, we have stressed the idea that exogenous shocks do
not exist in the real world. Still, they emerge from the purposive association
of naturally-occurring events with concrete research questions.  As a
\textit{corollary}, it is not the intrinsic characteristics of a
naturally-occurring event that make a powerful exogenous shock study. In other
words, `relevant events' are not necessarily sudden, such as the death of a
business leader because of a hearth attack, uncontrollable, such as earthquakes,
or random, such as lotteries.  Instead, the relevance of a naturally-occurring
event is contingent on the empirical and theoretical problems at hand. 

In the second arm of the paper, we have argued that not all exogenous shocks are
born equal. Our original taxonomy highlights three key features that 
differentiate exogenous shocks and help scholars anticipate which empirical 
strategy challenges are more likely to raise conditional on exogenous shock
types. Primarily, we have focused on three issues that have received limited or
no consideration at all amongst leadership and management studies: the scope of
applicability of Neyman's Potential Outcome Framework; the external validity of
the average treatment effect estimate --- i.e., the `LATE'
interpretation of statistical estimates; the existence of treatment interference
issues resulting in SUTVA violations.
