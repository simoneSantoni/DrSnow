Our research design aims to overcome this limitation by exploiting the disruption of political influence rents due to the sudden government change observed in two MENA countries following the Arab spring.  The exogeneity of government change is crucial for our identification strategy. For this purpose, two conditions are required. First, the change in government should happen rather quickly (not anticipated). This is true for Egypt and Tunisia but not for the other Arab Spring countries. Yemen and Libya, for instance, have changed their governments too but neither suddenly nor peacefully. In Yemen, the governmental change took about 1 year, and in Libya, it took 6 months, with a civil war. Second, countries that experienced a sudden change in government should be similar to other countries in the MENA region in terms of corruption, and quality of governance that determine the rent-seeking behavior of companies. According to Brownlee et al. (2013), countries that succeeded in changing their governments are neither major oil exporters nor dynastic states (see Table A1 in the Online Appendix). These authors consider dynastic states that rely on oil exports as bedrocks for corruption and favoritism. Lagi et al. (2011) also show that what triggered governmental changes in Egypt and Tunisia was not long-standing political failure (corruption); rather, it was the popular perceptions of regimes’ weakness in responding to sharp increases in global food prices. Figure 2(a), also shows that Tunisia and Egypt are not much different from other countries in the region concerning the strength of legal, and labor and capital market institutions. Therefore, without making any statistical inference and generalization, we can say that our findings may be also informative of the advantages held by business groups in MENA countries in general.",The use of sudden government change with appropriate control groups is the best choice to measure the benefits lost from the political influence which may come from a wide range of political activities,NaN

For the power change of a connected politician to be plausibly exogenous, whether and when the connected politician will experience the advancement has to be difficult to predict by lobbyists and firms. In addition, the change in lobbyist’s value creation due to a surge in the value of political connections should be uncorrelated with the accumulation of the lobbyist’s expertise, conditional on observables. Given the complicated and uncertain political process of chair selection and committee assignment, scholars have argued that committee and chair assignment satisfies these conditions with respect to lobbyists (Bertrand et al. 2014, Byun et al.2018). In fact, others have gone as far as to argue that the timing and ascension of committee and chair appointments are exogenous even to the politician herself (Liu and Srivastava2015). Thus, it is reasonable to believe that using the power change of a connected politician to capture discontinuous in-creases in the lobbyist’s relational capital would alleviate identification concerns due to potential omitted variable biases.","Connections to their former employers (e.g., politicians) are important sources of relational capital for ex-staffer lobbyists (Blanes i Vidal et al.2012).

The frictions in the market, and the resulting decrease in cooperation between parties, are not endogenous to technology or market characteristics. Second, the investigation directly affected only a subset of med- ical device firms, providing a natural control group with which we can compare the temporal patterns in innovation. The DOJ investigation involved five orthopedics companies, but physicians are active inventors in many medical device segments outside of orthopedics (Chatterji and Fabrizio, 2012). We can therefore compare the pattern of collaborative patenting and innovation by the five firms under investigation to other firms within orthopedics, and also to firms in other medical device segments, to isolate the effect of the lawsuit from other unobserved factors that affect commercialization strategies in the medical device industry as a whole, such as economy-wide fluctuations, the availability of venture capital, and the strength of intellectual property rights.  On September 27, 2007, a $3 10 million settlement was reached wherein four of the companies signed deferred prosecution agreements and one company (Stryker) signed a non-prosecution agreement, though notably none of the companies were required to admit guilt (Healy and Peterson, 2009). Under these settlement agreements, the companies agreed to increase transparency with substantial new disclosures, including prominently posting on their websites any payments to physicians (Hockenberry et al. 201 1). The companies also agreed to substantial oversight, including a monitor appointed by the DOJ, and a compliance officer who would report to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. The settlement agreements also required the companies to develop prospective budgets and produce needs assessments that justified their collaborations with physicians. If the companies succeeded in satisfying the conditions of the agreement, the DOJ stipulated that the conditions of the prosecution agreements would expire in 18 months (March 30, 2009), although the corporate-integrity programs established with the Office of the Inspector General were to stay in place for five years, until September 2012 (Healy and Peterson, 2009). According to media accounts, the settlement agreements had a dramatic impact on the operations of the companies involved (Healy and Peterson, 2009). In our Empirical Methodology section below, we will describe in detail how we coded the investigation and settlement periods to estimate the ""treatment effect"" of this legal action. While the companies reorganized their practices to satisfy the conditions of the settlement agreements, including disclosing information on payments to physicians, obtaining monitors, and fulfilling the other conditions of the agreements, ""business as usual was suspended"" (Healy and Peterson, 2009: 1974). Payments to physicians, as well as funding for scholarships, grants, and research, were canceled or put on hold. Once practices were aligned with the requirements, any companies desiring collaborations with physicians had to first pursue a needs assessment, pre-certify the work, and ascertain a fair market value for the work performed by the physicians (frequently resulting in rates much lower than the ones physicians were accustomed to, causing complaints).4 While we will compare the orthopedic firms under investigation to other orthopedic firms, we also present analyses with an alternative comparison group comprising firms commercializing cardiovascular devices, such as stents and heart valves. Firms generating cardiovascular innovations are a suitable control group because they are subject to identical regulations as the companies under investigation, the reliance on physician innovation is comparable, and other factors driving innovation (such as venture financing, health care policies, and demographic changes) are common across these two subsectors of the medical device industry. In sum, a byproduct of the DOJ investigation was that cooperation between orthopedic physicians and the five leading orthopedic device firms became much more costly, directly increasing the frictions in the ex ante market for ideas and potentially slowing the rate and altering the direction of innovation.","Previous studies have empirically documented the important role of practicing physicians as inventors and entrepreneurs in the market for ideas in the medical device industry (Chatterji and Fabrizio, 2012; Chatterji et al., 2008). Physicians contribute about 20 percent of the patented inventions in medical devices, and their inventions are, on average, more highly cited and more likely to be at the leading edge of new technologies (Chatterji and Fabrizio, 2012). A significant portion of these physician inventions are assigned to incumbent firms, reflecting the fact that physicians and medical device companies often work together to identify unmet clinical needs and develop successful prod- ucts, exactly in the spirit of the market for ideas literature. A transfer of ideas or technology between a physician and a medical device firm typically arise under one of two scenarios (Carlin, 2004).  In response to these conflict-of-interest concerns, the DOJ launched an investigation proceeding on March 30, 2005, against the five largest U.S. orthopedic device makers: Biomet, the DePuy Orthopedics unit of Johnson & Johnson, Smith & Nephew, Stryker Orthopedics, and Zimmer. These companies comprised 93-95 percent of sales in the hip and knee implant market in the United States (Healy and Peterson, 2009) and nearly 40 percent of all the innovations in orthopedics according to author calculations. The investigation, which resulted in a criminal complaint, alleged that the companies violated the federal anti-kickback statute (Healy and Peterson, 2009), in essence paying physicians to favor their own products in orthopedic procedures."

A new senator’s ability to relocate (from their first to second Congress) depends upon the occurrence of empty seats that can arise from either turnover within his or her party or winning a seat from the other party. As more senior colleagues depart, either voluntarily (through retirement) or involuntarily (through a lost election), desks are released for redistribution in a mechanism reminiscent of vacancy chains (Chase, 1991). As within-party turnover is largely outside the control of first-term senators (i.e., senior retirements and election outcomes are exogenous to the freshman), we run our baseline linear regression as above, but only including dyads where at least one of the senators is in his or her first or second Congress. For this regression, only changes in Chamber floor locations between an individual’s first and second Congresses will be associated with a change in bill co-sponsorship.  Although there is a penchant for senior senators to occupy desks near the center of the Chamber, some senators deviate from this pattern (see Figure 2). For example, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) had chronic back pain and, as a result, chose to sit at the rear of the Chamber in order to have ease of access from the cloakroom to his desk (Don Ritchie, Senate Historian, personal communication). We define individuals like Senator Kennedy as “iconoclasts” and suggest that the Chamber distance between these senators and other senators is largely nonpurposive.","For example, senator j may “flow” past iconoclast i as she is presented with opportunities to move toward the most popular seats near the front of the Chamber.

Prolonged public discourse may facilitate affected companies’ efforts to anticipate legislation. But anticipation of the timing and consequences of regulatory change can be only partial, for two reasons. First, many actions that organizations might take to prepare themselves for a new regulatory regime are barred until dates specified in legislation. Prior to such dates, affected organizations cannot finalize plans or implement change. For example, when the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 was passed, airlines became free to enter and exit routes according to an explicit timetable set up in the act. Loosening of regulatory constraints took seven years, until the Civil Aeronautics Board was dismantled in 1985. According to one analyst, for this industry “the process of deregulation proved chaotic from the start” (Vietor 1989, p. 180) and was clarified only as much time passed. Between passage and full implementation of major legislation, many factors critical to performance can shift, further complicating attempts to plan and execute appropriate actions. Second and more critical is the fact that large-scale regulatory change generates unintended outcomes (Merton 1936). Despite investments in predictive intelligence, industry incumbents tend to make incorrect forecasts about how major regulatory change will actually play out (Leone 1985). A classic case of the unanticipated consequences of major regulatory change occurred after the breakup of AT&T. At issue was the question of whether AT&T, which retained its long-distance, equipment, and research functions, would outperform its offspring, the seven “Baby Bells,” which were to provide local telephone service. In the Yale Journal on Regulation, two prominent participants in the AT&T divestiture proceedings argued that “[c]learly, AT&T has won by losing, by having been left with the cream of its old services but with the restrictions on its ability to compete in those services removed” (MacAvoy and Robinson 1983, p. 42). Roughly 18 months later, the same authors returned to the pages of the same journal with a second article (MacAvoy and Robinson 1985), in which they outlined how state regulators unexpectedly asserted themselves after the breakup and blocked plans to increase local rates, forcing AT&T to transfer long-distance revenues to local companies. Only at this point did it become clear that the Baby Bells, not AT&T, would perform better after the breakup. That state commissions would play such an activist role came as a revelation to virtually all analysts and industry executives (MacAvoy and Robinson 1985, p. 245). Thus, although it was the focus of widespread analysis and speculation, this regulatory punctuation propelled affected firms well beyond predicted bounds. Regulatory change also can produce unexpected results by fostering shifts in competitive conditions that ex ante appear limited, but that later overwhelm predictions. One seemingly innocuous regulatory intervention that produced enormous change was one part of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978. Among other, more widely noted statutes in PURPA was a law mandating that utilities purchase power from third-party producers at a price equal to the cost the utility would have incurred had it produced the electricity itself. In less than a decade, the number of third-party producers grew enormously (Russo 2001), and their role in the inter-organizational community shifted from supplier to direct competitor (Joskow 1988). In sum, although organizations affected by regulatory punctuations may act purposively, partial foresight and imprecise prediction of their impact generate substantial unintended consequences. The one sure thing is that conditions in a new regulatory regime will stabilize and become well understood only after a period of flux. Because of this, the aftermath of large-scale regulatory change can best be understood by applying a model of punctuated evolution.",NaN,"In 1982, the California State Legislature released this pressure for change by enacting the nation’s first managed-competition program. The expectation was that healthcare costs could be contained by unleashing market forces. To this end, the legislature created incentives for healthcare providers to compete on price. They also dismantled the Certificate-of-Need review process, which had protected established providers from competition. Nonhospital entrepreneurs were now free to compete with hospitals by offering selected services at lower prices. Meanwhile, the federal government phased in a new prospective-payment system, in which Medicare reimbursed providers according to predetermined rates tied to patient diagnoses, rather than cost-plus reimbursement. In sum, falling reimbursement rates squeezed hospitals’ profit margins. These changes eroded boundaries separating three distinct sectors: acute-care hospitals, health-care financing, and independent and group-practice medicine.

Given that the pilot program was not designed to influence firms' CSR activities or any CSR-related corporate decisions (i.e., the regulation-induced increase in stock price risk is exogenous with respect to CSR), we can establish a causal effect from the anticipated stock price decline risk to managerial insurance motives to pursue CSR.","We posit that, in response to Reg SHO, pilot firms would increase CSR relative to nonpilot firms to insure against elevated short-selling threats and growing stock price decline risk.6 First, CSR ensures top management's attention on social criteria and such states of mind can reduce the likelihood of unethical and socially harmful activities, thereby providing short sellers fewer opportunities to exploit. Even though pilots and nonpilots had the same degree of exposure to negative events, short sellers would have preferred to target pilots as they were not restricted from taking positions to further drive down the prices of those stocks when prices started falling. In other words, conditioning on the incidence of negative events, greater short-selling threats increased the probability of the negative events being exploited in a bear raid. Because of this greater susceptibility to negative events, pilot firms had incentives to increase CSR to lower the incidence of bad events. We refer to this as the prevention effect of CSR. Second, stakeholders are more likely to give high-CSR firms the benefit of the doubt and impose less severe punishment when negative events occur (Godfrey, 2005). This insurance effect of CSR can reduce a stock's price sensitivity to adverse events (Godfrey et al., 2009; Koh et al., 2014; Minor & Morgan, 2011; Shiu & Yang, 2017). To earn greater profits, short sellers tend to target stocks with greater risk of a price drop, and lower stock price sensitivity to negative events may discourage short sellers from targeting high-CSR firms (Jain, Jain, & Rezaee, 2016)."

The Unitrin ruling further expanded the circumstances under which a hostile bid was considered a threat and relaxed the judicial scrutiny in the proportionality review (Gilson, 2001). As a result, while the other three cases mainly apply to Delaware firms with staggered board, Delaware Supreme Court’s ruling on Unitrin (decided in January 1995) more broadly affected all Delaware firms. As Subramanian (2004) noted, “at the same time that the YWC trilogy was solidifying Just Say No for the majority of public corporations that have staggered boards, Unitrin was strengthening the Just Say No defense for companies more generally.” Since antitakeover laws are typically supported by a small number of firms rather than by large coalitions (Romano, 1987), these legal changes should be regarded as exogenous events for most firms, and thus, can be used as natural experiments in which the corporate governance environment is exogenously altered for firms incorporated in the legislated states.","Another benefit of our focus on Delaware’s legal shift in takeover is the wide scope of its influence on the U.S. economy. Many U.S. firms (57% in our sample) are incorporated in Delaware, and all Delaware-incorporated firms are affected by the legal change regardless of their specific locations of operations.",NaN
zhang2020,TRUE,iOS 7 jailbreak,"The event is an exogenous shock to Apple's gatekeeping policy, aiming to orchestrate developers' value creation activities in the AppStore. That allows scholars to appreciate the impact of platform governance on knowledge sharing among developers.",Software piracy,Theory testing & empirical / attenuating endogeneity concerns,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Regression,DiD,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"The jailbreak of iOS 7 especially fits current analyses because the timing of the jailbreak was unexpected. The iOS 7 upgrade notably improved system security against jailbreaks. According to Apple's security reports and the U.S. National Vulnerability Database, known exploits (i.e., loopholes) used in previous jailbreaks were patched in the iOS 7 system, making jailbreaking especially challenging. Moreover, unlike previous jailbreaks that usually documented hackers' progress on social media sites, iOS 7's jailbreak was hidden from the public.5 Thus, the technical community at that time was pessimistic about the possibility of a jailbreak of iOS 7 (Anthony, 2013). Overall, the timing of the jailbreak of iOS 7 was considered uncertain, given the technical complexity and the opaque hacking progress.6 The unusually long time for the iOS 7 jailbreak to be released (i.e., 95 days)7 also gives us sufficient time to observe changes in knowledge sharing activities before and after the treatment. We thus used a quasi-experimental design to compare the knowledge sharing activity of iOS developers (treatment group) with that of “shock-immune” Android app developers (control group) before and after the jailbreak, as illustrated in Figure 1. This difference-in-differences (DD) approach helps reduce endogeneity and strengthen the causality of findings (Angrist & Pischke, 2009).","We focus on an exogenous lapse of platform gatekeeping, an externally caused weakening in gatekeeping that grants platform access to complementors who are otherwise rejected.  To test the hypotheses, we focus on Apple's iOS app platform, a leading platform for mobile software applications, and examine iOS developers' knowledge sharing after an exogenous lapse in platform gatekeeping due to the jailbreak of iOS 7. The iOS jailbreak is a hacking that exploits loopholes to remove iOS built-in restrictions. After the jailbreak, apps that were previously rejected by iOS's app review became available to users, representing a lapse in the gatekeeping of iOS. In a typical jailbreak, a few elite hackers jointly developed an automated jailbreaking program and made it available to the public for free.2 After installing the program, iOS users could easily jailbreak their devices and install apps that were unavailable in the Apple App Store (i.e., jailbreak apps). A major type of jailbreak apps is pirated apps (i.e., copycats or cracked apps), which are explicitly discouraged by the app review.3 Pirated apps typically closely imitate or directly copy the functionalities of existing legitimate apps but are offered to users for a discount or even free (Geng & Lee, 2013), causing significant revenue losses to iOS app developers (Koetsier, 2017; Rasch & Wenzel, 2013).4 Some pirated apps are unreliable and may even contain malicious content, which could damage customer experience and result in user attrition (Lahiri & Dey, 2013). Consequently, the business stealing and user attrition induced by jailbreak apps could intensify the competitive pressure faced by iOS developers and affect their knowledge sharing. For this reason, iOS jailbreak provides an appropriate context in which to test our hypotheses.","To examine changes in complementors' knowledge sharing after an exogenous lapse in platform gatekeeping, we follow extant research in both coopetition and platform literatures, focusing on the coopetitive incentives of incumbent complementors who offer digital products with novel features or functionalities on innovation platforms (Wen & Zhu, 2019). We argue that a lapse in gatekeeping shifts the incumbent complementors' coopetitive balance toward competition for two reasons. First, such a lapse may directly intensify competition among complementors by granting unrestricted platform access to entrants who seek to imitate incumbent complementors and offer complements with overlapping or substitutive features (Parker & Van Alstyne, 2018). An extreme case occurs when some entrants opportunistically misappropriate market-proven complementary offerings by directly copying the designs and functionalities used by concept originators (e.g., copycat developers or software crackers) (Wang et al., 2018), yet conventional intellectual property protections may not easily extend to the protection of visual aspects, functionality, and sequences of such offerings (e.g., software applications) (Boudreau, 2012). Platform users thus end up consuming imitating offerings (Belleflamme & Peitz, 2019), lowering the user count for original ones. This situation may induce a strong sense of business stealing and concerns about a decrease in the market share of the incumbent complementors, shifting their coopetitive incentives toward competition. Second, a lapse in gatekeeping may also indirectly intensify competition among complementors by reducing overall platform attractiveness (Casadesus-Masanell & Halaburda, 2014). For one reason, imitating complements (e.g., cracked apps) often suffer from quality problems (Lahiri & Dey, 2013). However, with the juxtaposition of original complements and low-quality knockoffs, it is difficult for users to assess the quality ex ante, resulting in a “lemons” problem (Belleflamme & Peitz, 2019). For another, platform users may overly explore (due to a lack of perfect foresight about others' choice) original and imitating complements, weakening the overall utility of complements to users (Casadesus-Masanell & Halaburda, 2014; Halaburda, Piskorski, & Yildirim, 2018). For example, the distraction of imitating software may dilute user feedback such as bug reports (Arora, Caulkins, & Telang, 2006; Jiang, Sarkar, & Jacob, 2012), hindering quality improvements of such software and damaging the overall user experience (Cennamo & Santalo, 2013). Consequently, platforms may become less attractive to users after a lapse in gatekeeping. Since a reduction in platform attractiveness tends to associate with potential losses of existing and prospective users, incumbent complementors' concerns about a decrease in their market shares may become more prominent, shifting their coopetitive incentives toward competition."

Leveraging its extensive webpage coverage, advanced algorithms, and rich operation experience, Google expanded rapidly and became widely used by scientists and inventors in China to access business information and scientific knowledge (Qiu, 2010). In 2010, Google ceased operating in China because it refused to accept the censorship intervention from the Chinese government. However, inventors in China were still able to access Google since the company redirected all search requests from China to its Hong Kong site (Tan & Tan, 2012). Google then experienced two temporary blockades in 2012, both of which lasted only a few hours. This situation continued until June 1, 2014 when all direct visits from China to Google services worldwide were suddenly blocked (Google, 2019). The blockade came with no prior notice, and no reasonable explanation was ever given regarding how exactly this decision was made. It was particularly surprising because Google had formally exited the China market 4 years ago and made no further confrontation since then. Although at the time it was speculated that this blockade would again be temporary, it has lasted more than 5 years and remains in force as of today.","Google is one of the most advanced and integrated online search tools. It handles more than 90% of search requests worldwide and covers content in over 100 languages. Its market leadership rests squarely on its competence in several upstream technologies such as webpage crawling, language processing, information indexing, data storage, and information retrieval. The company has over 11,000 US patents on information storage and retrieval, 50% more than Microsoft, which owns the second largest search engine, Bing. Such patents are extremely important for search engines and illustrate Google's technological dominance. Along with its core search engine, Google also developed supplementary services such as Google Patents, Google Translate, and Google Scholar, which are valuable for professionals or inventors to access high-quality technological and scientific knowledge. ","Google can be conceptualized as a map encompassing the metaknowledge of “where to find what” for Internet users (Sparrow, Liu, & Wegner, 2011). On the one hand, it continuously stores and updates directories and indexes to a gigantic volume of knowledge contents, and therefore functions as an external transactive memory for its users. On the other hand, its relevancy and ranking algorithms, building on technologies such as natural language processing and neural networks, enable even nonexpert users to query these contents in an easy and efficient way. In this regard, Google is also an intelligent knowledge retrieval system. The combination of these two functions equips its users with the metaknowledge, or a higher-order map, of the Internet. The importance of Google in China, particularly for knowledge workers, was evident. In a 2010 Nature survey of approximately 800 scientists in China, virtually all responded that they depended on Google to search for academic papers and the latest news. Eighty percent of respondents believed that losing Google would “somewhat or significantly” hamper their research (Qiu, 2010). In addition, an annual survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China found that 31% of corporate respondents were unable to properly seek information and engage in R&D due to China's Internet censorship (European business in China: Business confidence survey, 2018). Our interviews with engineers and scientists from leading technology firms and research universities in China also suggested that Google was indeed the major portal for them to seek both industry news and domain-specific knowledge whenever it was available. All the evidence above suggests that blocking Google may cause a substantial disruption for researchers and inventors in China. We consider this exogenous shock as a golden opportunity to examine the role of Google-enabled online search in facilitating innovation. In the next section, we develop a conceptual framework regarding online search vis Google and formally hypothesize how the blockade of Google affects innovation in China."
