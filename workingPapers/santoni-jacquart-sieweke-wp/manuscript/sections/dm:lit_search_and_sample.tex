Consistently with review articles recently published in the Journal of
Management \parencite[e.g.][]{gonzalez2018,rindova2018}, we restrict our
literature review to a selection of prominent journals such as Academy of
Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Entrepreneurship Theory
and Practice, Journal of Business Ethics, Journal of Business Venturing, Journal
of Management, Journal of Management Studies, The Leadership Quarterly,
Management Science, Organization Science, Organization Studies, Research Policy,
Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, Strategic Management Journal, Strategic
Organization.  Using the search engine embedded in each journal's web page (see
Table \ref{tab:journal_search} reported in the Appendix), we searched for
articles published after January 2000 that show the token ``natural
experiment*'' in the full text.

We retrieved 479 publications, 249 of which were eventually included in the
review. Figures \ref{fig:sampling_workflow} \ref{fig:exclusion_causes}, reported in the Appendix, jontly illustrate
the samplign procedure. Figure 3 reports the inter-temporal distribution of the retained studies.
