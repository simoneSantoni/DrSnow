% we introduce the reader to Dunning's framework 
The standard natural experiment resembles the
design of a randomized experiment. Naturally occurring events (such
as earthquakes \parencite[e.g.,][]{Belloc2016}) are supposed 
to determine a statistical unit's treatment status. As show in
Figure \ref{fig:ne_logic_viz}, the availability of longitudinal data
makes possible to estimate the causal effect of the treatment by
contrasting the pre-post change in the outcome variable $y$ across
the control group ($\gamma$) and the treatment group 
($ \gamma + \delta$).
