Utilizing state level antitakeover protections as an exogenous shock, we find that when managers are afforded greater job security through these protections they exhibit a higher probability of initiating a Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) program. Furthermore, the positive effect of job security on CVC adoption is stronger when firms are research intensive, and when there are slack financial resources. Our results suggest that providing managers leeway to experiment while ensuring job security is important for corporate entrepreneurship and the willingness to experiment with innovative strategies. Managerial Summary: Entrepreneurial activity often involves identifying opportunities that the rest of the marketplace overlooks. While this risk taking is celebrated as part of entrepreneurial folklore, in pragmatic terms, for managers of public organizations, it requires going against the prevailing wisdom of important stakeholders. Since stakeholders can hold considerable influence over top managers' employment, managers may avoid innovation if they feel experimentation and/or failure could cost them their jobs. This study demonstrates that when top managers have more job security, they are more likely to experiment with new organizational forms and structures by establishing Corporate Venture Capital units. The study demonstrates that job security not only impacts the amount of risk taken within existing operations, but also the willingness to experiment with novel ideas and activities. © 2020 Strategic Management Society","corporate entrepreneurship; corporate venture capital; governance; innovation; market for corporate control",,"Abadie, A., Athey, S., Imbens, G.W., Wooldridge, J., When should you adjust standard errors for clustering?

We exploit an exogenous shock on firms’ risk environment created by the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) and analyze related risk disclosure in annual reports of public firms in the UK. Using this unique setting, we mitigate concerns about omitted variables in concurrent studies. The findings suggest that board gender diversity is positively related to corporate risk disclosure. However, our results also indicate that the proportion of female directors needs to reach a critical mass to impact the risk disclosure decision. Moreover, we find lower bid–ask spreads immediately after the referendum date for those firms that disclosed Brexit-related risks in their annual reports prior to the vote.

We exploit an exogenous shock, China's unexpected blockade of Google in 2014, and adopt a difference-in-differences approach with a matched sample of patents from China and nearby regions to test our predictions. Our analyses show that the blockade negatively affected inventors in China to search distantly in technological and cognitive spaces compared to those in the control group who were presumably unaffected by the event. The impact was less severe for inventors with larger collaboration networks but became more pronounced in technological fields proximate to science. Our findings contribute to innovative search literature and highlight the theoretical and practical importance of Internet technologies in developing valuable inventions. Managerial summary: Inventors nowadays depend heavily on Internet search to access information and knowledge. They therefore become vulnerable to barriers imposed on their online search. In this study, we find that China's unexpected blockade of Google and its affiliated services altered the searching behavior of inventors in China such that they became less able to seek distant knowledge. This impact was further contingent on the availability of offline knowledge channels and the reliance of each technological field on science. We also find that the economic value of their inventions decreased due to the blockade. Our findings reveal a neglected but consequential aspect of Internet censorship beyond the commonly found media effect and offer important implications to practitioners and policymakers. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","distant search; Google; innovation; Internet censorship; recombinant search","Search engines; Collaboration network; Difference-in-differences; Exogenous shocks; Internet censorship; Internet searches; Internet technology; Practical importance; Searching behavior; Patents and inventions","Ahmadpoor, M., Jones, B.F., The dual frontier: Patented inventions and prior scientific advance (2017) Science, 357 (6351), pp. 583-587; Alcacer, J., Gittelman, M., Patent citations as a measure of knowledge flows: The influence of examiner citations (2006) Review of Economics and Statistics, 88 (4), pp. 774-779; Argote, L., (2012) Organizational learning: Creating, retaining and transferring knowledge, , New York, NY, Springer; Arts, S., Fleming, L., Paradise of novelty—Or loss of human capital?

Trulaske, Sr. College of Business, University of Missouri, United States","The increasing presence of women in upper echelon positions draws attention to the possible effects of executive gender on corporate decisions and actions. In this study, we formulate theory about the impact of chief financial officer (CFO) gender on financial misreporting to generate two key insights. First, we hypothesize that firms with female CFOs will have a lower likelihood of financial misreporting than comparable firms with male CFOs. Second, we argue that the relation between CFO gender and financial misreporting will be contingent on governance mechanisms (e.g., institutional ownership and analyst coverage), such that misreporting of firms with male CFOs will differ more compared to that of firms with female CFOs when governance is weak. Our results, based on a novel leading indicator of the likelihood of financial misreporting, provide support for our predictions. Various alternative econometric specifications, including (but not limited to) exogenous shocks, propensity score matching, and modeling treatment effects, random effects, firm fixed effects, and hybrid effects provide general support for our theory and hypotheses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © Academy of Management Journal.",,,"Abbasi, A., Albrecht, C., Vance, A., Hansen, J., Metafraud: A meta-learning framework for detecting financial fraud (2012) Management Information Systems Quarterly, 36, pp. 1293-1327; Adams, R.

A difference-in-differences test reveals that pilot firms increased CSR more than nonpilot firms and that in particular they reduced CSR concerns and increased CSR that impacts stakeholders involved in direct resource exchange. We also find that pilot firm CSR reduced short positions against them and that the effect is stronger for CSR concerns and CSR that impacts directly connected stakeholders. Overall, we document a causal effect of stock price risk on managerial incentives to invest in CSR for risk management. Managerial Summary: Corporate social responsibility has many purported benefits, one of which is that it can insure against the adverse stock price effects of negative events. But do managers purposefully use CSR in this way and do such investments provide intended insurance-like benefits? By taking advantage of a natural experiment where a randomly selected set of pilot firms were exposed to elevated short-sale risk unleashed by the SEC regulation, we find evidence that they do. Once the SEC initiated the regulatory change, firms that faced greater risk increased CSR more than firms that did not. In addition, increased CSR lowered short interests in pilot firms' stocks and this reduction is attributable to the insurance-like effect of CSR rather than simply prevention of adverse events.

However, the mechanisms behind this relationship remain unclear as business groups may create value for their affiliates via market and non-market strategies. We advance this discussion by leveraging an exogenous shock, namely the sudden government changes ignited by the Arab Spring, to examine: (a) whether business groups hold a competitive advantage in the political environment that enhances the performance of their affiliates and (b) which type of business groups provide that advantage to their affiliates. Our results suggest that the positive effect of group affiliation on performance is not only driven by groups’ capabilities to earn superior rents in the market environment as alluded in the literature, but also by their capabilities to earn greater influence rents compared to standalone firms in the political environment. This performance effect is stronger for affiliates of family than for non-family business groups, suggesting that political influence capabilities are heterogeneusly distributed across business group types. © The Author(s) 2020.","Arab Spring; business groups; emerging economies; family business groups; family firms; government; nonmarket strategy; or political strategies; ownership structure",,"Ahuja, G., Yayavaram, S., PERSPECTIVE—Explaining influence rents: The case for an institutions-based view of strategy (2011) Organization Science, 22 (6), pp. 1631-1652; Alaref, J., Wasta once again hampering Arab youth chances for a dignified life (2014) The World Bank, , https://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/wasta-hampering-arab-youth-chances-dignified-life, 13, March; Almeida, H.V., Wolfenzon, D., A theory of pyramidal ownership and family business groups (2006) The Journal of Finance, 61 (6), pp. 2637-2680; Amin, M., Assaad, R., al-Baharna, N., (2012) After the Spring: Economic Transitions in the Arab World, , Oxford, Oxford University Press; Belenzon, S., Berkovitz, T., Innovation in business groups (2010) Management Science, 56 (3), pp. 519-535; Berger, R., Silbiger, A., Herstein, R., Analyzing business-to-business relationships in an Arab context (2015) Journal of World Business, 50 (3), pp. 454-464; Bertrand, M., Mehta, P., Mullainathan, S., Ferreting out tunneling: An application to Indian business groups (2002) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117 (1), pp. 121-148; Birhanu, A.G., Gambardella, A., Valentini, G., Bribery and investment: Firm-level evidence from Africa and Latin America (2016) Strategic Management Journal, 37 (9), pp. 1865-1877; Blau, B.M., Brough, T.J., Thomas, D.W., Corporate lobbying, political connections, and the bailout of banks (2013) Journal of Banking & Finance, 37 (8), pp. 3007-3017; Bonardi, J.-P., Hillman, A.J., Keim, G.D., The attractiveness of political markets: Implications for firm strategy (2005) Academy of Management Review, 30 (2), pp. 397-413; Bonardi, J.-P., Holburn, G.L., Bergh, R.G.V., Nonmarket strategy performance: Evidence from U.S. electric utilities (2006) The Academy of Management Journal, 49 (6), pp. 1209-1228; Brownlee, J., Masoud, T., Reynolds, A., Why the modest harvest?

Emerging literature on platform governance suggests that platform access control can shape complementors' contributions to platforms. We extend this literature by using the coopetition framework from strategic management to examine the relationship between platform gatekeeping, a prominent policy for governing platform access, and knowledge sharing among complementors. Exploiting the iOS 7 jailbreak as an exogenous shock to Apple's gatekeeping policy and tracing iOS and Android app developers' knowledge sharing activity on an online forum, we find causal evidence that a lapse in gatekeeping reduces knowledge sharing among iOS app developers. Further, this effect is mitigated among developers with greater knowledge complexity but magnified among those with greater knowledge routineness. Managerial Summary: Platform owners can use governance policies, such as gatekeeping, to control complementors' platform access and shape their value creation activities. This study examines how platform access control affects the interactions among complementors in the form of knowledge sharing. We find that iOS app developers share knowledge less frequently after a lapse in Apple's gatekeeping policy, suggesting that strict platform access control can facilitate complementors' interactions with one another. Further, the decrease in knowledge sharing is more pronounced among app developers with routine knowledge and less so among those with complex knowledge, indicating that complementors' characteristics also matter. This study highlights the value of understanding the impact of the design and deployment of platform governance policies on complementors' interactions and value creation activities more generally. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","complementor; gatekeeping; innovation; knowledge sharing; platform governance","Fruits; iOS (operating system); Knowledge management; Public policy; Co-opetition; Exogenous shocks; Gatekeeping; Knowledge-sharing; Online forums; Share knowledge; Strategic management; Value creation; Access control","Abdalkareem, R., Shihab, E., Rilling, J., On code reuse from StackOverflow: An exploratory study on Android apps (2017) Information and Software Technology, 88, pp. 148-158; Adner, R., Ecosystem as structure: An actionable construct for strategy (2017) Journal of Management, 43 (1), pp. 39-58; Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: How the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, 31 (3), pp. 306-333; Allison, P., Waterman, R., Fixed–effects negative binomial regression models (2002) Sociological Methodology, 32 (1), pp. 247-265; Angrist, J.D., Pischke, J., (2009) Mostly harmless econometrics: An Empiricist's companion, , Princeton, Princeton University Press; Anthony, S., (2013), . iOS 7 jailbreak for iPhone and iPad When, if ever, will the jailbreak be ready?; Aral, S., Van Alstyne, M., The diversity-bandwidth trade-off (2011) American Journal of Sociology, 117 (1), pp. 90-171; Arora, A., Caulkins, J.P., Telang, R., Research note – Sell first, fix later: Impact of patching on software quality (2006) Management Science, 52 (3), pp. 465-471; Beattie, G., Durante, R., Knight, B., Sen, A., (2019), Advertising spending and media bias Evidence from news coverage of car safety recalls, (NBER Working Paper 23940); Belleflamme, P., Peitz, M., Managing competition on a two-sided platform (2019) Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 28 (1), pp. 5-22; Bertrand, M., Morse, A., Information disclosure, cognitive biases, and payday borrowing (2011) The Journal of Finance, 66 (6), pp. 1865-1893; Birkinshaw, J., Nobel, R., Ridderstrale, J., Knowledge as a contingency variable: Do the characteristics of knowledge predict organization structure?

Using the variation in state-level changes in inheritance, gift, and estate taxes as an exogenous shock to family control, we find that family firms, particularly those in which a founder serves as chief executive officer or those in which a family member serves as a director on the board, treat their employees better than nonfamily firms. More importantly, family firms focus on investing in employee relations that help alleviate laborrelated conflicts and controversies, possibly to avoid a negative family reputation among stakeholders. Family firms' better treatment of their employees is also evident when we use a difference-in-difference test to exploit changes in family firm status due to (sudden) deaths of family members and firms' inclusion in Fortune's ""100 Best Companies to Work For"" list to identify employee-friendly treatment. We further find that family firms in the early stage of their life cycle invest more in employee relations when they operate in laborintensive industries in which the benefits from family owners' monitoring of employees are expected to be large. Moreover, we find that although nonfamily firms' investment in employee relations is impeded by several constraints, such as short-term investor pressure, managerial myopia, and managerial agency problems, family firms do not suffer from such constraints. These findings help explain why underinvestment in employee relations is prevalent in public firms despite potential long-termbenefits from such intangible investment. © 2019 INFORMS.","Agency problem; Concern score; Employee-friendly policy; Endogeneity; Family firm; Founder; Labor-intensive industry; Life cycle; Managerial myopia","Managers; Ophthalmology; Taxation; Agency problems; Concern score; Endogeneity; Family firms; Founder; Labor intensive; Managerial myopia; Life cycle","Adams, R., Ferreira, D., Do directors perform for pay?

Thicker markets can offer more opportunities for participants to meet and higher chances that a potential match exists. However, they can also be vulnerable to potential search frictions. In this paper, using data from an online peer-to-peer holiday property rental platform, we aim to identify and measure the causal impact of market thickness on matching rates. In particular, we exploit an exogenous shock to market size caused by a one-time migration of listings from other platforms, which gives rise to a quasiexperimental design. We find that increased market thickness actually leads to lower matching rates. Keeping search technology and other factors constant, doubling market size leads to a 15.4% reduction in traveler confirmation rate and a 15.9% reduction in host occupancy rate. As a result, the platform lost 5.6% of potential matches because of the increased market size. We attribute the effect to increased search friction: travelers’ search intensity increases by 18.3% when market size doubles. This effect is especially prominent when the matching needs to take place within a limited time. Our results offer insights for future empirical and theoretical research on matching markets. They also highlight that is important for platform owners to watch out for increased search frictions as markets grow and invest in search technologies to facilitate more efficient search. © 2019 INFORMS","Difference-in-differences; Market thickness; Matching markets; Matching supply and demand; Quasiexperiment","Commerce; Friction; Business modeling; Difference-in-differences; Online platforms; Quasiexperiment; Search intensity; Search technology; Supply and demand; Theoretical research; Investments","Allon, G., Bassamboo, A., Cil, E.B., Large-scale service marketplaces: The role of the moderating firm (2012) Management Sci, 58 (10), pp. 1854-1872; Armstrong, M., Competition in two-sided markets (2006) RAND J.

We integrate research on time horizons with stakeholder theory and argue that, in response to short-term pressure from financial analysts, firms and their managers become more short-term focused and limit investment in socially responsible activities. Using broker mergers and closures in the United States as exogenous shocks to analyst coverage and a difference-in-differences research design, we find that an exogenous decrease in analyst coverage leads to better CSP, establishing a causal relationship between analyst coverage and the level of a firm's CSP. The impact of financial analysts on a firm's CSP is exacerbated if the terminated analyst works for a larger brokerage house and has more general- and firm-specific experiences. Managerial summary: This study looks at the relationship between financial analysts, a key stakeholder group of the capital market, and a firm's socially responsible activities. Using a sample of U.S. publicly listed firms during the period of 2001–2013, our study finds novel evidence that the pressure to meet earnings target set by financial analysts hinders a firm's socially responsible performance. In addition, this pressure is more salient for firms with analysts that work for large brokerage houses and have more experiences. This study provides new insights to corporate social responsibility research by evaluating the impact of financial analysts on firms' social engagement. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","corporate social performance; financial analysts; natural experiments; stakeholders; time horizons","Economic and social effects; Managers; Corporate social performance; Financial analysts; Natural experiment; stakeholders; Time horizons; Finance","Aguinis, H., Glavas, A., What we know and don't know about corporate social responsibility: A review and research agenda (2012) Journal of Management, 38 (4), pp. 932-968. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206311436079; Balakrishnan, K., Billings, M., Kelly, B., Ljungqvist, A., Shaping liquidity: On the causal effects of voluntary disclosure (2014) Journal of Finance, 69 (5), pp. 2237-2278. , https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12180; Balls, E., Summers, L.H., (2015), https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IPC-PDF-full.pdf, Report of the commission on inclusive prosperity, Center for American Progress.

Drawing on the unfolding model of voluntary turnover, we develop a theory proposing that positive shocks to external relational capital will catalyze employees to consider alternative employment options, thereby increasing the probability of exit. We further maintain that exit decisions in response to such shocks will be driven by a desire to appropriate more value, making these shocks strong predictors of employee entrepreneurship, especially when the employee works in an area that is peripheral to the firm's core capabilities. Empirically, we construct a unique employee-employer linked database that tracks employment of lobbyists in the United States federal lobbying industry. Leveraging plausibly exogenous shocks to the value of an employee's relational capital and a novel market-based measure of the employee's position in the firm's knowledge space, we report two sets of findings. First, an increase in the value of relational capital has a positive effect on the likelihood of mobility to established firms and employee entrepreneurship, with the effect for the latter stronger than the former. Second, the magnitude of the effect on employee entrepreneurship becomes stronger when the employee is peripheral to the firm's core knowledge. Together, our results are consistent with a value creation-value appropriation rationale, where sudden increases in the value of an employee's relational capital drive exit as a means to appropriate a greater portion of value created. © 2019 INFORMS.","Employee mobility; Entrepreneurship; Human resource management",,"(2015) Your partner compensation system can be better: Here's how, , White paper, Aderant Holdings, Inc., Atlanta; Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept (2002) Acad.

An exogenous change due to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, which made student debt completely nondischargeable through personal bankruptcy, reduced the likelihood of entrepreneurship by student loan borrowers that were already in four-year college at the time of this regulation. Moreover, an exogenous shock to the level of student debt due to the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 negatively impacts entrepreneurship rates for students already in four-year college at the time of this regulation. Entrepreneurs with more student debt are more likely to fall behind on their student debt payments, and this relation is mitigated when their ventures are successful. Our evidence indicates that student debt inhibits entrepreneurship by exacerbating the effect of negative business outcomes on the individual. © 2018 INFORMS.","Entrepreneurship; Start-up financing; Student debt; Student loan; Survey of consumer finance","Costs; Business outcomes; Consumer finance; Entrepreneurship; Exogenous shocks; Higher education; Students","https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/102/s1150; Abraham, K., Clark, M., Financial aid and students’ college decisions: Evidence from the district of Columbia tuition assistance grant program (2006) J.

Competitive pressure from the product market aggravates managers’ incentive to withhold negative information. When negative information is accumulated to a tipping point, the accumulated information comes out all at once and leads to an abrupt and large decline in stock price. Using a measure of product market threats, our regressions find that firms facing more threats are more prone to stock crashes. This result is confirmed by an instrumental variable analysis and a difference-in-difference analysis with an exogenous shock to market competition. © 2018 INFORMS","Market competition; Product market threats; Stock crash risk","Competition; Competitive pressure; Crash risk; Difference-in-differences; Exogenous shocks; Instrumental variables; Market competition; Negative information; Product markets; Commerce","Aghion, P., Bloom, N., Blundell, R., Competition and innovation: An inverted-U relationship (2005) Quart.

We study involvement of middle managers in decision making, focusing on how rewards and controls shape resource allocation. We argue that higher income growth uncertainty (rewards) and lower monitoring (controls) increase resource allocation most strongly when middle managers are more involved in decisions. We test the arguments for ATM and bank branch allocations in Indian banks from 2011 to 2014. We assess causal mechanisms by comparing more and less favorable conditions for allocation, as well as considering a poststudy exogenous shock. The results suggest that the rewards and controls have different associations with resource allocation depending on the involvement of senior and middle managers. Managerial Summary: The study examines how rewards and controls shape resource allocation decisions by middle managers, focusing on rewards arising from uncertainty about employee income and controls based on monitoring. The work suggests that rewards and controls that influence resource allocation by one level of managers may have less effect for another level. Hence, a firm's plans for resource deployment need to include rewards and controls that are relevant for both senior and middle managers. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","agency problems; incentives; middle managers; resource allocation; senior managers","Automatic teller machines; Decision making; Resource allocation; Agency problems; Automated teller machines; Favorable conditions; incentives; Middle managers; Resource allocation decision; Resource deployments; Senior managers; Managers","Agarwal, R., Helfat, C.E., Strategic renewal of organizations (2009) Organization Science, 20 (2), pp. 281-293; Ai, C., Norton, E.C., Interaction terms in logit and probit models (2003) Economics Letters, 80 (1), pp. 123-129; Allison, P.D., Waterman, R.P., Fixed-effects negative binomial regression models (2002) Sociological Methodology, 32 (1), pp. 247-266; Anand, J., Redeployment of corporate resources: A study of acquisition strategies in the US defense industries, 1978–1996 (2004) Managerial and Decision Economics, 25 (6-7), pp. 383-400; Anand, J., Kim, H., Lu, S., Resource characteristics and redeployment strategies: Toward a theoretical synthesis (2016) Advances in strategic management, pp. 155-184. , F.

Using debt financing settings, we examine whether a firm’s religious environment influences outside parties’ perceptions in contracting with the firm. We document that firms located in the more religious areas use less debt financing and receive better credit ratings. Bond investors require lower yields and impose fewer covenants on such firms. Using the 2002 revelation of sex abuse by Catholic priests as an exogenous shock, we verify that these findings are not driven by endogeneity issues.

Customers can learn from the inventory level and update their beliefs about the product. Thus, consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by the availability information. Based on a unique setting from Amazon lightning deals, which displays the percentage of inventory consumed in real time, we explore whether and how consumers learn from inventory availability information. Identifying the effect of learning on consumer decisions has been a notoriously difficult empirical question because of endogeneity concerns. We address this issue by running two randomized field experiments on Amazon in which we create exogenous shocks on the inventory availability information for a random subset of Amazon lightning deals. In addition, we track the dynamic purchasing behavior and inventory information for 23,665 lightning deals offered by Amazon and use their panel structure to further explore the relative effect of learning. We find evidence of consumers learning from inventory information: a decrease in product availability causally attracts more sales in the future; in particular, a 10% increase in past claims leads to a 2.08% increase in cart add-ins in the next hour. Moreover, we show that buyers use observable product characteristics to moderate their inferences when learning from others; a deep discount weakens the learning momentum, whereas a good product rating amplifies the learning momentum. © 2018 INFORMS.","Amazon; Field experiment; Flash sales; Inventory availability; Learning; Retail operations","Lightning; Purchasing; Sales; Amazon; Consumer purchasing behaviors; Field experiment; Inventory information; Learning; Product characteristics; Purchasing behaviors; Retail operations; Consumer behavior","Anderson, E.T., Fitzsimons, G.J., Simester, D., Measuring and mitigating the costs of stockouts (2006) Management Sci., 52 (11), pp. 1751-1763; Banerjee, A.V., A simple model of herd behavior (1992) Quart.

Using a unique dataset of Chinese and Indian herbal patents filed in the United States, we find that an increase in the supply of first-generation ethnic migrant inventors increases the rate of codification of herbal knowledge at U.S. assignees by 4.5%. Our identification comes from an exogenous shock to the quota of H1B visas and from a list of entities exempted from the shock. We also find that ethnic migrant inventors are more likely to engage in reuse of knowledge previously locked within the cultural context of their home regions, whereas knowledge recombination is more likely to be pursued by teams comprising inventors from other ethnic backgrounds. Managerial Summary: Managers and policy makers around the world face a vigorous debate on whether to hire skilled migrants or hire locals. We argue that if western firms stop hiring ethnic migrants, innovation at these firms would suffer in two ways: knowledge transfer and knowledge recombination would both be impeded. We argue and show that skilled ethnic migrants bring to their employers, unique knowledge from the cultural context of their host country. Also, local inventors engage in “knowledge recombination” by combining their existing knowledge to knowledge transferred by migrants. Our empirical results relate to the patenting of Chinese and Indian herbal formulations at western pharmaceutical firms before and after an immigration shock related to the admittance of skilled migrants from these two countries. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cultural context; ethnic migration; first-generation migrant; H1B visa; knowledge flow; knowledge recombination; knowledge reuse; recombinant creation; skilled migration","Knowledge management; Patents and inventions; Cultural context; ethnic migration; first-generation migrant; H1B visa; Knowledge flow; knowledge recombination; Knowledge reuse; recombinant creation; skilled migration; Managers","Agrawal, A., Kapur, D., McHale, J., Oettl, A., Brain drain or brain bank?

Using social connections within the executive team to capture the team's interaction, cooperation, and teamwork, we find that social connections among team members are associated with higher management forecast accuracy, consistent with economic theories that information is dispersed within a firm and with sociology insights that social connections facilitate information sharing. Further analyses show that the association between social connections and forecast accuracy is stronger when the teams are just beginning to work together, when their firms face more uncertainty or adversity, and when the CEOs are less powerful. Our results hold for a subsample of executive teams that experience pseudo exogenous shocks to their social connectedness. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of teamwork among executives in the forecast generation process. © 2018 INFORMS.","Executive team; Management forecast; Social connection","Forecasting; Uncertainty analysis; Economic theories; Executive team; Forecast accuracy; Generation process; Higher management; Information sharing; Management forecasts; Social connection; Human resource management","Ajinkya, B., Gift, M., Corporate managers' earnings forecasts and symmetrical adjustments of market expectations (1984) J.

I find that the real effects of a credit supply shock are linked to local lending market characteristics. Changes in local credit supply have significant real effects in lending markets dominated by small banks, while there is no effect in other markets. These results suggest that small banks, which do not benefit from deep internal capital markets, face economically meaningful frictions in accessing external interbank markets to fund loans. The effect in other markets, which have large multimarket banks, indicates that these markets are not as dependent on local funding sources for lending. These findings illustrate the important role that the internal capital markets of banks have on real outcomes. © 2017 INFORMS.","Bank deposits; Bank lending; Credit supply; Exogenous shock; Shale","Financial markets; Oil booms; Shale; Shale gas; Bank lending; Credit supply; Exogenous shocks; Funding sources; Interbank market; Market characteristics; Oil and natural gas; Commerce","Adelino, M., Ma, S., Robinson, D., Firm age, investment opportunities, and job creation (2017) J.

The results indicate that firms with confident chief executive officers (CEOs) are 24% more likely to report their research and development (R&D) expenditures relative to firms with cautious CEOs. Exploiting staggered, state-level regulatory shocks and changes in CEO type, we find substantial evidence that cautious CEO firms fail to report R&D expenditures. After a plausibly exogenous shock to managerial reporting liability, cautious CEO firms exhibit a 35% larger reduction in unreported R&D relative to confident CEO firms. Interestingly, confident CEO firms do not exhibit more innovation than their cautious CEO counterparts after taking into account their differing propensities to report corporate R&D. Overall, our analysis suggests that the precision or reliability of mandatory disclosures systematically varies with managerial characteristics. © 2017 INFORMS.","Corporate opacity; Innovation; Mandatory disclosure; Missing R&D; Overconfident CEOs","Reliability analysis; Chief executive officer; Exogenous shocks; Financial disclosure; Mandatory disclosure; Overconfident CEOs; Research and development; Managers","Armstrong, C., Larcker, D., Ormazabal, G., Taylor, D., The relation between equity incentives and misreporting: The role of risktaking incentives (2013) J.

This paper tests whether Chapter 11 restructuring outcomes are a ected by time constraints in busy bankruptcy courts. Using the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act as an exogenous shock to caseloads, I find that commercial banks report lower charge-o s on business lending when court caseloads decline, suggesting that the costs of financial distress are lower in less-congested courts. Further, court caseload a ects how restructuring takes place. Less-busy bankruptcy judges liquidate fewer small firms, but more large firms. When caseload declines, large firms spend less time in court and firms that are dismissed from court are less likely to refile for bankruptcy. In addition, firms are less likely to sell assets or obtain debtor-in-possession financing in less-busy courts. © 2017 INFORMS.","Bankruptcy; Chapter 11; Financial distress; Time constraints","Consumer protection; Bankruptcy; Bankruptcy courts; Chapter 11; Commercial bank; Debtor in possessions; Exogenous shocks; Financial distress; Time constraints; Costs","Agarwal, S., Amromin, G., Ben-David, I., Chomsisengphet, S., Piskorski, T., Seru, A., Policy intervention in debt renegotiation: Evidence from the home a ordable modification program (2017) J.

Institutional and ownership structures that favor employees can influence firms’ location decisions and shareholders’ incentives to invest. Using data from the main copper mines in the world, we show that the value appropriated by employees rises in response to an exogenous increase in the price of minerals. Our results indicate that the magnitude of the increment in the value captured by employees is larger in stated-owned companies, when labor regulations promote productivity-based payments, when wages are determined through a centralized bargaining process, and when regulations associated with hiring and firing are more flexible. Managerial Summary: We show how labor regulations and state ownership affect the value appropriated by employees when there are exogenous changes in the price of the firm's products. Since the value generated by a firm is distributed among different stakeholders, a higher appropriation of value by employees results in lower appropriation by another party. Therefore, by changing the distribution of value, managerial decisions about location and entry could be affected. For instance, shareholders of firms with positive future expectations about the prices of their products might prefer to enter markets in which salary negotiations are not centralized or where partnership with the local government is not mandatory. Overall, our analysis calls for the consideration of the external environment when evaluating value appropriation by different types of stakeholders.

We argue that, in such situations, building teamwork around a star is an exercise in learning under complexity. In response, organizations prioritize interactions involving the star to simplify learning. This simplification, however, creates organizational myopia. We claim that a star’s temporary absence helps the organization overcome myopia by triggering a search for new routines. When he returns, the organization may combine these new routines with pre-absence routines to improve teamwork and performance. We exploit injuries to star players in the National Basketball Association as an exogenous shock and find that on average, teams perform better after a star’s return than before his absence. Managerial Summary: This study examines the effect of the temporary absence of a star evidence that a star employee’s temporary absence helps the organization overcome an over-reliance on the star and improve teamwork. Improved teamwork, in turn, enables the organization to perform better upon the star’s return than it did prior to his absence. This result suggests that organizations might want to revisit the tendency to view stars as too valuable to lose, even for a short time. In particular, organizations may want to pull stars from ongoing projects and encourage them to attend professional development programs. A star’s temporary absence and return from such a program improves not only the star’s skills but also the organization’s teamwork.

Our measure is based on the intuition that informed traders are more likely than uninformed traders to generate abnormal volume in options or stock markets. We formalize this intuition theoretically and compute the resulting multimarket information asymmetry measure (MIA) for firm-days as a function of unsigned volume totals and without estimating a structural model. Empirically, MIA has many desirable properties: it is positively correlated with spreads, price impact, and absolute order imbalances; predicts future volatility; is an effective conditioning variable for trading strategies stemming from price pressure; and detects exogenous shocks to information asymmetry. © 2017 INFORMS.","Information asymmetry; Liquidity; Market microstructure; Options","Management; Operations research; Information asymmetry; Liquidity; Market microstructures; Measure of information; Options; Order imbalances; Structural modeling; Trading strategies; Commerce","Aktas, N., De Bodt, E., Declerck, F., Van Oppens, H., The PIN anomaly around M&A announcements (2007) J.

In this article, we review the substantial number of studies that have examined the ways by which institutions are created, modified, or transformed, highlighting the lack of integration of prior works that emphasize exogenous shocks, institutional entrepreneurship, and practice-based change. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, we then develop a novel typology of pathways of change that more comprehensively brings together this diverse literature, accounts for the richness and heterogeneity of institutional change processes unveiled by studies to date, and provides a more synthetic framework to guide future research. Based on our analysis and theorizing, we discuss important new scholarly directions that will enhance our understanding of different kinds of institutional change processes and outcomes, as well as contribute to further development of the institutional logics perspective. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","change pathways; institutional logics; institutional theory (sociology)",,"Ahmadjian, C.L., Robinson, P., Safety in numbers: Downsizing and the deinstitutionalization of permanent employment in Japan (2001) Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, pp. 622-654; Allmendinger, J., Hackman, J.R., Organizations in changing environments: The case of East German symphony orchestras (1996) Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, pp. 337-369; Amis, J., Slack, T., Hinings, C., The pace, sequence, and linearity of radical change (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47, pp. 15-39; Ancona, D.G., Goodman, P.S., Lawrence, B.S., Tushman, M.L., Time: A new research lens (2001) Academy of Management Review, 26, pp. 645-663; Ansari, S.S., Phillips, N., Text me!

We develop a framework that specifies how centralization of intragroup equity ties affects the performance of group affiliates. We use the exogenous shock of the 2008 financial crisis and a difference-in-differences analysis of 51,730 observations of business group affiliates in Taiwan to show that centralization of equity ties enhances affiliate performance, but such effects weaken when the environment becomes turbulent. Moreover, we find that listed affiliates obtain fewer benefits from centralization than unlisted affiliates. Overall, our study deepens scholarly understanding of not only how groups create value, but also how value is differentially appropriated among affiliates. Managerial summary: Our research speaks directly to owner-managers of business groups with respect to creating an optimal equity network structure that binds the affiliated firms of the group. Our findings suggest to managers that the overall structure of equity ties in a business group has major implications for the performance of the affiliate firms of the group, and the network structure within the group should be designed deliberately and thoughtfully on an on-going basis. In particular, control through centralized equity ties is performance-enhancing in normal periods, but such control may be counterproductive as turbulence increases in business environments, or as the number of listed group firms increases. Hence, owner-managers may consider optimizing the network structure by lowering the degree of centralized equity ties under such circumstances, or at a minimum, lowering centralized control.

In particular, takeover threats may lead to managers' reluctance to adopt a strategy toward firm-specific knowledge accumulation because implementing this strategy requires them to acquire specialized skills, which are at risk under takeover threats. Conversely, takeover protection leads to an increase in firm-specific knowledge. Further, the relationship between takeover protection and firm-specific knowledge is positively moderated by managerial ownership, which helps align managerial interests with those of shareholders. But the relationship is negatively moderated by managerial tenure, as long-tenured managers have already committed to their firms. Using a differences-in-differences method with Delaware antitakeover rulings in the mid-1990s as an exogenous shock, we found results supporting these arguments. Managerial summary: We examined how changes in the Delaware antitakeover rulings in mid-1990s affected the knowledge structure of firms incorporated in Delaware. We reasoned that with a greater level of takeover protection, top managers of those firms incorporated in Delaware felt higher job security, thus providing them stronger incentives to make strategic decisions toward the development of firm-specific knowledge and to make corresponding human capital investments in specialized skills. Empirically, firms incorporated in Delaware were found to have an increase in the level of firm-specific knowledge in their knowledge structure after the mid-1990s. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the role of takeover protection on top manager incentives is particularly salient when the managers are awarded with more company shares and when the managers have shorter organizational tenure.

Based on the longitudinal analysis of changing network configurations in the global airline industry, we explore how logics of attachment shift before, during and after an exogenous shock and how the rewiring of network ties in response to the shock may act as a countervailing force to the network dynamics that drive field stratification. Using the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 as a natural experiment, our work reveals how shocks may affect key mechanisms of network evolution thus altering tie distribution and access among members of the field. Overall this article contributes to emergent literature on field dynamics by exposing the evolution of interorganizational dynamics when external events produce unsettled times that render extant logics brittle and open prospects for change. © The Author(s) 2015.","core/periphery; environmental jolt; field evolution; network change; rules of attachment",,"Aegean, Lufthansa and Aegean Airlines starting extensive cooperation (2014) Passengers will benefit from increased number of flights and improved connections, , http://en.aegeanair.com/all-about-us/press-office/press-releases/press-release/?prid=179, October,,.

Although this literature has described important features of this market, how it influences the rate and direction of innovation remains an open question. We exploit an exogenous shock to a subset of U.S. medical device firms to study this question. We first document the breakdown in the market for ideas after a federal investigation made it more difficult for the leading orthopedic firms to work with physician-inventors. We then present evidence of a dramatic decline in the rate of innovation for these firms. Further, a marked shift in direction occurs toward lower-quality inventions and away from product categories where physician knowledge is critical. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","health care; innovation strategy; market for ideas; market for technology; open innovation","Biomedical equipment; Commerce; Health care; Exogenous shocks; Important features; Innovation strategy; Innovative activities; Market for technology; Medical device industry; Open innovation; Product categories; Innovation","Agarwal, A., Cockburn, I., Zhang, L., (2013) Deals Not Done: Sources of Failure in the Market for Ideas, , NBER Working paper w19679, Cambridge, MA National Bureau of Economic Research; Arora, A., Ceccagnoli, M., Patent protection, complementary assets, and firms' incentives for technology licensing (2006) Management Science, 52 (2), pp. 293-308; Arora, A., Fosfuri, A., The market for technology in the chemical industry: Causes and consequences (2000) Revue d'Economie Industrielle, 92, pp. 317-334; Arora, A., Fosfuri, A., Gambardella, A., Specialized technology suppliers, international spillovers and investment: Evidence from the chemical industry (2001) Journal of Development Economics, 65 (1), pp. 31-54; Arora, A., Fosfuri, A., Gambardella, A., (2004) Markets for Technology: The Economics of Innovation and Corporate Strategy, , The MIT Press: Cambridge, MA; Arora, A., Gambardella, A., The market for technology (2010) Handbook of the Economics of Innovation, 1, pp. 641-678. , Hall B.

Under bank financing, a debt-type contract emerges as optimal, which allows the entrepreneur to retain full control of the venture and thus yields strong effort incentives, as long as the entrepreneur can service the debt repayment however, this leads to liquidation in the case of default, making the venture's success quite sensitive to exogenous, even temporary, shocks that may hinder debt repayment. Under VC financing, an equity-type contract emerges as optimal. Although it is not sensitive to exogenous shocks, this contract requires the entrepreneur to share a fraction of the rents with the financier, thus yielding lower effort incentives for the entrepreneur. There exists a threshold level of venture risk such that bank financing is optimal if and only if venture risk is below that threshold. Product market competition increases the value of stronger entrepreneurial incentives and thus increases the maximum level of risk the entrepreneur is willing to take before switching from bank financing to VC financing. This is a robust result that is shown to hold in various models of competition, including the Hotelling, Salop, Dixit-Stiglitz, and Cournot-to-Bertrand switch. © 2015 INFORMS.","Bank Financing; Competition; Venture Capital; Venture Risk","Competition; Investments; Debt repayment; Exogenous shocks; Full control; Maximum levels; New ventures; Product market competitions; Threshold levels; Venture Capital; Commerce","Abowd, J., Lemieux, T., The effects of product market competition on collective bargaining agreements: The case of foreign competition in Canada (1993) Quart.

We propose that, within a forum, an individual's location structures his or her access to peer support, but individuals with power (i.e., those who control the flow of organizational resources) can transcend these geographic constraints. We examine these propositions with data collected on strategic actors in the U.S. Senate Chamber. Using a dyad fixed effects approach, time-varying controls, selection-on-observables estimation, and quasi-exogenous shocks to seating arrangements, we find support for our propositions. These results contribute to our understanding of strategic interaction patterns, with an emphasis on the geographic scaffold upon which strategic actions are constructed.

These costs are smaller when turnover is expected, as in the case of maternity leave, or when loan officers have incentives to transfer information, as in the case of voluntary resignations. © 2014 INFORMS.","Banking; Corporate finance; Incentives; Information; Intermediation; Organizational studies; Performance","Banking; Management; Operations research; Corporate finance; Incentives; Information; Intermediation; Organizational studies; Performance; Personnel","Agarwal, S., Hauswald, R., Distance and private information in lending (2010) Rev.

We use an exogenous shock-the implementation of labor scheduling software- and time-lagged instrumental variables to disentangle the endogeneity between demand and supply in this setting. We show that servers strive to maximize sales and speed efforts simultaneously, depending on the relative values of sales and speed. As a result, we find that, when the overall workload is small, servers expend more and more sales efforts with the increase in workload at a cost of slower service speed. However, above a certain workload threshold, servers start to reduce their sales efforts and work more promptly with the further rise in workload. In the focal restaurant chain, we find that this saturation point is currently not reached and, counterintuitively, the chain can reduce the staffing level and achieve both significantly higher sales (an estimated 3% increase) and lower labor costs (an estimated 17% decrease). © 2014 INFORMS.","Behavioral operations management; Business analytics; Econometrics; Empirical study on staffing; Quality/speed trade-off; Restaurant operations; Worker productivity","Chains; Personnel selection; Scheduling; Wages; Behavioral operations; Business analytics; Econometrics; Empirical studies; Restaurant operations; Worker productivities; Sales","Afifi, A.A., Clark, V., May, S., (2004) Computer-aided Multivariate Analysis, , CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL; Akşin, O.Z., Harker, P.T., Modeling a phone center: Analysis of a multichannel, multiresource processor shared loss system (2001) Management Sci., 47 (2), pp. 324-336; Akşin, Z., Armony, M., Mehrotra, V., The modern call center: A multi-disciplinary perspective on operations management research (2007) Production Oper.

Drawing on the attention-based view, strategic issue diagnosis theory, and construal level theory, we propose and test a theoretical model of differentiated attention among managers within a firm driven by desirability (shock distance) and feasibility (capability perception) considerations. Managers more distant from the locus of the shock and managers with stronger ex ante perceptions regarding organizational capabilities to address the shock paid more attention to opportunity aspects and less attention to threat aspects. We also found subordination effects between shock distance and capability perception, and a moderating role of domain-specific experience on the effects of capability perception.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","attention; capability perception; opportunity; shock distance; threat","attention; Attention-based views; Construal levels; opportunity; Organizational capabilities; shock distance; Theoretical models; threat; Industry; Management; Managers","Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Sage: Beverly Hills, CA; Barnett, M.L., An attention-based view of real options reasoning (2008) Academy of Management Review, 33 (3), pp. 606-628; Barr, P.S., Stimpert, J.L., Huff, A.S., Cognitive change, strategic action, and organizational renewal (1992) Strategic Management Journal, Summer Special Issue, 13, pp. 15-36; Bouquet, C., Birkinshaw, J., Weight versus voice: How foreign subsidiaries gain attention from corporate headquarters (2008) Academy of Management Journal, 51 (3), pp. 577-601; Budescu, D.V., Yu, H.-T., Aggregation of opinions based on correlated cues and advisors (2007) Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 20 (2), pp. 153-177; Chattopadhyay, P., Glick, W.H., Miller, C.C., Huber, G.P., Determinants of executive beliefs: Comparing functional conditioning and social influence (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20 (8), pp. 763-789; Chi, M.T.H., Feltovich, P.J., Glaser, R., Categorization and representation of physics problems by experts and novices (1981) Cognitive Science, 5 (2), pp. 121-152; Cho, T.S., Hambrick, D.C., Attention as the mediator between top management team characteristics and strategic change: The case of airline deregulation (2006) Organization Science, 17 (4), pp. 453-469; Cyert, R.M., March, J.G., (1963) A Behavioral Theory of the Firm, , Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Day, D.V., Lord, R.G., Expertise and problem categorization: The role of expert processing in organizational sense-making (1992) Journal of Management Studies, 9 (1), pp. 35-47; Denison, D.R., Dutton, J.E., Kahn, J.A., Hart, S.L., Organizational context and the interpretation of strategic issues: A note on CEO's interpretations of foreign investment (1996) Journal of Management Studies, 33 (4), pp. 453-474; Doucet, L., Service provider hostility and service quality (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47 (5), pp. 761-771; Dutton, J.E., Ashford, S.J., Selling issues to top management (1993) Academy of Management Review, 18 (3), pp. 397-428; Dutton, J.E., Duncan, R.B., The creation of momentum for change through the process of strategic issue diagnosis (1987) Strategic Management Journal, 8 (3), pp. 279-295; Dutton, J.E., Fahey, L., Narayanan, V.K., Toward understanding strategic issue diagnosis (1983) Strategic Management Journal, 4 (4), pp. 307-323; Dutton, J.E., Jackson, S.E., Categorizing strategic issues: Links to organizational action (1987) Academy of Management Review, 12 (1), pp. 76-90; Einhorn, H.J., Hogarth, R.M., Ambiguity and uncertainty in probabilistic inference (1985) Psychological Review, 92 (4), pp. 433-461; Eyal, T., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., Walther, E., The pros and cons of temporally near and distant action (2004) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86 (6), pp. 781-795; Fischer, I., Budescu, D.V., When do those who know more also know more about how much they know? the development of confidence and performance in categorical decision tasks (2005) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 98 (1), pp. 39-53; Green, Jr.S.E., Li, Y., Nohria, N., Suspended in self-spun webs of significance: A rhetorical model of institutionalization and institutionally embedded agency (2009) Academy of Management Journal, 52 (1), pp. 11-36; Hair, J.F., Black, W.C., Babin, B.J., Anderson, R.E., Tathan, R.L., (2006) Multivariate Data Analysis, , (6th edn).

Association with a stigmatized category does not automatically result in disapproval, because straddling multiple categories dilutes stakeholder attention to the stigma. In addition, category saliency moderates the effect of category straddling on disapproval. Findings from the global arms industry highlight how managers can modify categorical associations at the industry and customer levels to decrease disapproval, and I discuss implications for diversification and internationalization strategies. Results also highlight how an exogenous shock (the 9/11 terrorist attacks) modified the saliency of the categories used by arms industry stakeholders. Finally, this study shows that category straddling results in more neutral social evaluations for firms, making positive evaluations less positive, and negative ones less negative. © Academy of Management Journal.",,,"Arellano, M., Bond, S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations (1991) Review of Economic Studies, 58, pp. 277-297; (2011) The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, , www.theatlantic.com, Atlantic Accessed March; Baltagi, B.H., (2005) Econometric Analysis of Panel Data, , (3rd ed.).

We use the September 11, 2001 attacks as a research setting to investigate the relationship between international diversification and MNC performance after a sudden change in the environment. The empirical tests on a sample of 191 U.S. MNCs and a matched sample of non-U.S. MNCs indicate that the level of pre-September 11 international diversification is negatively correlated with immediate cumulative abnormal returns to shares, but positively correlated with longer-term performance.

We hypothesize that ratings are particularly likely to spur responses from firms that receive poor ratings, and especially those that face lower-cost opportunities to improve or that anticipate greater benefits from doing do. We test our hypotheses in the context of corporate environmental ratings that guide investors to select 'socially responsible,' and avoid 'socially irresponsible,' companies. We examine how several hundred firms responded to corporate environmental ratings issued by a prominent independent social rating agency, and take advantage of an exogenous shock that occurred when the agency expanded the scope of its ratings. Our study is among the first to theorize about the impact of ratings on subsequent performance, and we introduce important contingencies that influence firm response. These theoretical advances inform stakeholder theory, institutional theory, and economic theory.

Much of the work on technological discontinuities has focused on macro levels of analysis such as industries and technologies rather than specific firms. This study uses a historical perspective on Formula 1 motor racing to explore the dynamics between firm level performance and technological discontinuities over a 57 year period. The study supports the findings of previous research that incumbent firms are often unable to adapt to the impact of exogenous shocks. However the study also reveals situations where a relatively small number of firms are able to sustain their competitive superiority through a number of successive discontinuities. I suggest that, in addition to dynamic capabilities, these firms possess sustaining capabilities - munificent resource configurations which extend the time available for firms to adapt to technological changes - thereby allowing them to remain competitive across discontinuities. © 2010 The Author.

They discount change - which they lack the capacity to explain (other than through exogenous shocks) - and neglect diversity within countries. This paper focuses on the national culture model which it argues requires commitment to illogical arguments and to suppositions which are theoretically and empirically untenable. An evaluation of each, it is argued, points to the existence of, and possibilities for, considerable national diversity and change - not pervasive and enduring national uniformity. Reflecting on the model's rise and fall in anthropology, the paper also provides an outline explanation of its retention within organization studies and speculates about its future within that discipline. © The Author(s), 2009.","Action; Agency; Diversity; Incoherent culture; Knowledge community; National culture; Organizational culture; Practice; Values",,"Adler, N.J., (2002) International Dimensions of Organizational Behaviour, , 4th edn, Cincinnati, OH: South-Western; Allport, F.H., The group fallacy in relation to social science (1924) American Journal of Sociology, 29, pp. 699-706; Alvesson, M., (2002) Understanding Organizational Culture, , London: Sage; Archer, M.S., (1988) Culture and Agency: The Place of Culture in Social Theory, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Augier, M., March, J.G., Sullivan, B.N., Notes on the evolution of a research community: Organization studies in Anglophone North America, 1945-2000 (2005) Organization Science, 16 (1), pp. 85-95; Bakhtin, M., (1984) Problems of Dostoevsky's poetics, , [1929], (ed. and trans.

To examine which adopter characteristics matter, I use the introduction of a video-messaging technology in an investment bank. I use data on its 2,118 employees, their adoption decisions, and their 2.4 million subsequent calls. The video-messaging technology can also be used to watch TV. Exogenous shocks to the benefits of watching TV are used to identify the causal (network) externality of one individual user's adoption on others' adoption decisions. I allow this network externality to vary in size with a variety of measures of informal and formal influence. I find that adoption by either managers or workers in ""boundary spanner"" positions has a large impact on the adoption decisions of employees who wish to communicate with them. Adoption by ordinary workers has a negligible impact. This suggests that firms should target those who derive their informal influence from occupying key boundary-spanning positions in communication networks, in addition to those with sources of formal influence, when launching a new network technology. © 2008 INFORMS.","Network externalities; Networks; Social networks; Technology management; Video conferencing","Adoption decisions; Boundary spanners; Communication networks; Investment banks; Network externalities; Network technologies; Networks; Social networks; Technology adoptions; Technology management; User characteristics; Economics; Industrial management; Investments; Personnel; Technology; Video conferencing; Network management","Allison, P.D., Discrete-time methods for the analysis of event histories (1982) Social.

This paper examines the following research question in the context of this change: What are some factors that influence transition economy firms to successfully change their operating know-how or knowledge sets to reflect the demands of their new environment? Building on some core ideas from literature on organizational imprinting, knowledge-based view of the firm, and firm search, we suggest that two factors have a profound impact on a firm's ability to change. The imprinting effect of firms' prior socialist institutional and market environment adversely impacts their ability to change their operating knowledge. At the same time, firms that search for new knowledge from distant sources (located in mainly non-socialist countries) are able to successfully change their knowledge to meet the demands of the new market-oriented economy. Both of these aspects also have joint interdependent effects on the success of change; distant search mitigates some of the adverse impact of socialist market imprinting, but that is not the case for the impact of socialist institutional imprinting. These findings have interesting implications for both researchers and practitioners involved in transition economy settings.

This paper models both research and development (R&D) and disembodied technical advance using neo-classical equations, which specify the equilibrium stocks as a function of prices and output. The elasticity of R&D in the production function, estimated using factor shares, is time-varying and increasing. Returns to scale are increasing in all factors. The most important aspect of the model is that the equilibrium rate of technical advance is not cyclically invariant, but co-moves with output at business cycle frequencies. This allows the production function to behave as a stochastic trend. Growth accounting demonstrates that long-term variations in the rate of productivity growth have been associated mainly with low-frequency fluctuations in the rate of disembodied technical advance, with secondary effects from the stocks of R&D and physical capital. During the high productivity period 1948-1972, technical advance contributed 1.48 percentage points per year to output, with 0.98 accounted for by R&D. The productivity slowdown of the mid-1970s was accounted by a gradual decline in the effect of R&D, and a more abrupt collapse in disembodied technology. The subsequent productivity revival was associated with two accelerations in disembodied technical advance, the first beginning in the early 1980s, and the second in the mid-1990s. The production function is simulated in a small econometric model. Model simulations find that exogenous shocks to the inflation rate generate significant variations in growth by inducing fluctuations in disembodied technology. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We highlight how the aesthetic logic that traditionally informs the practices of the symphony yielded, in the face of declining orchestral resources, to a more commercially oriented market logic. As institutionalists have argued, shifts in logics are often catalysed by exogenous shocks. In the ASO, this blending of aesthetic and market logics became salient in the wake of a pivotal organizational event, the 1996 musicians' strike. Qualitatively comparing pre- and post-strike reviews of ASO performances, we find that the discourse of critics shifted to capture the changing logic of the symphony: post-strike reviews were more attuned to market than aesthetic aspects of the symphony. Nonetheless, their reviews suggested that judgments based on notions of cultural authenticity were virtually unaffected. Although our results echo existing claims that art world critics often act in a ritualistic fashion, serving as gatekeepers for the authenticity of cultural genres, we extend scholarship by highlighting how critics' stories are embedded in broader discursive fields that reveal how they patrol the boundaries of genres. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.",,,"Allmendinger, J., Hackman, J.R., Organizations in changing environments: The case of East German Symphony Orchestras (1996) Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, pp. 337-389; (1993) Americanizing the American Orchestra, Report of the National Task Force for the American Orchestra: An Initiative for Change, , Washington, DC: The American Symphony Orchestra League, June; Anand, N., Peterson, R.A., When market information constitutes fields: Sensemaking of markets in the commercial music industry (2000) Organization Science, 11, pp. 270-284; Arian, E., (1971) Bach, Beethoven and Bureaucracy, , Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press; Ashforth, B.E., Humphrey, R.H., The ubiquity and potency of labeling in organizations (1997) Organization Science, 8, pp. 43-58; Bagdikian, B.H., (2000) The Media Monopoly, 6th Edition, , Boston, MA: Beacon Press; Bartunek, J., Changing interpretive schemes and organizational restructuring: The example of a religious order (1984) Administrative Science Quarterly, 29, pp. 355-372; Baumann, S., Intellectualization and art world development: Film in the United States (2001) American Sociological Review, 66, pp. 404-426; Baumann, S., Marketing, cultural hierarchy, and the relevance of critics: Film in the United States, 1935-1980 (2002) Poetics, 30 (4), pp. 243-262; Becker, H.S., Art as collective action (1974) American Sociological Review, 39, pp. 767-776; Becker, H.S., (1982) Art Worlds, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Bielby, W., Bielby, D., ""All hits are flukes"": Institutionalized decision making and the rhetoric of network prime-time program development (1994) American Journal of Sociology, 99, pp. 1287-1313; Blau, J.R., Study of the arts: A reappraisal (1988) Annual Review of Sociology, 14, pp. 269-292; Blau, J.R., Blau, P.M., Golden, R.M., Social inequality and the arts (1985) American Journal of Sociology, 91, pp. 309-331; Bourdieu, E., (1990) The Logic of Practice, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Bourdieu, P., (1992) The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field, , (translated by Susan Emanuel, 1996).

There are two diametrically opposing view-points. Adaptation theories predict that change occurs as fluid organizations adjust to meet shifting environmental demands, while selection theories predict that change occurs through the differential selection and replacement of inert organizations as environmental demands vary over time. Our paper bridges these polar opposites by using a punctuated equilibrium framework to examine organizations' responses to discontinuous industry-level change. This framework recognizes that the histories of many industries are occasionally punctuated by dramatic exogenous shocks, such as radical technological innovation, social and political turmoil, major changes in government regulation, and economic crashes. Our central thesis is that such environmental punctuations dramatically reduce pressures and rewards for organizational inertia and thereby alter both organizations' propensities for change and their survival chances following change. We focus on one form of punctuation, major regulatory change, and study firms in two industries: general hospitals and savings and loan associations. For organizations in both industries, we examine three important outcomes: shifts in organizational domain, CEO succession, and changes in financial performance. Our analyses show that punctuational regulatory change prompts shifts in organizational domains and executive leadership. Additionally, post-punctuation domain change and post-punctuation CEO succession both affect subsequent performance. We discuss our results in light of current thinking about the content and process effects of core organizational change, which has been developed in the context of stable environments. Finally, we argue for the development of more temporally sensitive theories of organizational action.","CEO succession; Deregulation; Organizational change; Organizational evolution; Organizational inertia; Organizational performance; Punctuated equilibrium",,"Aldrich, H.E., (1999) Organizations Evolving, , Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA; Amburgey, T.L., Kelly, D., Barnett, W.P., Resetting the clock: The dynamics of organizational change and failure (1993) Admin.

We decompose accounting earnings into permanent and transitory components and postulate that dividend policy is driven by sustainable permanent earnings. Two measures of permanent earnings are proposed. The first is a permanent earnings variable extracted from accounting earnings by a random-level shift ARMA model. The second measure is stock price times cost of capital. These two permanent earnings measures are employed in the Marsh-Merton (1987) model to explain corporate dividend behavior and their performance is compared. A generalized friction method is adopted for empirical estimation to account for stepwise dividend movements over time. Results show that the permanent earnings measure extracted from accounting earnings data explains dividend dynamic behavior better than stock price.","Error-Correction; Exogenous Shocks; Generalized Friction Models; Monte Carlo Simulation; Permanent and Transitory Earnings; Steady-State Targets; Survivorship Bias","Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Decision theory; Error correction; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Random processes; Regression analysis; Earnings informations; Exogenous shocks; Generalized friction models; Steady-state targets; Risk management","Aharony, J., Swary, I., Quarterly dividend and earnings announcement and stockholders returns: An empirical analysis (1980) J.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted at 23 entrepreneurial firms, I identify the components of embedded relationships and explicate the devices by which embeddedness shapes organizational and economic outcomes. The findings suggest that embeddedness is a logic of exchange that promotes economies of time, integrative agreements, Pareto improvements in allocative efficiency, and complex adaptation. These positive effects rise up to a threshold, however, after which embeddedness can derail economic performance by making firms vulnerable to exogenous shocks or insulating them from information that exists beyond their network. A framework is proposed that explains how these properties vary with the quality of social ties, the structure of the organization network, and an organization's structural position in the network.",,,"Abolafia, M.Y., (1996) Taming the Market, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Asanuma, B., The organization of parts purchases in the Japanese automotive industry (1985) Japanese Economic Studies, SUMMER, pp. 32-53; Aumann, R., Sorin, S., Cooperation and bounded recall (1989) Games and Economic Behavior, 1, pp. 5-39; Axelrod, R., (1984) The Evolution of Cooperation, , New York: Basic Books; Baker, W.E., Market networks and corporate behavior (1990) American Journal of Sociology, 6, pp. 589-625; Batson, D.C., How social an animal: The human capacity for caring (1990) American Psychologist, 45, pp. 336-346; Baum, J.A.C., Oliver, C., Institutional embeddedness and the dynamics of organizational populations (1992) American Sociological Review, 57, pp. 540-559; Bazerman, M., Neale, M., (1992) Negotiating Rationally, , New York: Free Press; Burt, R., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Burt, R., Knez, M., Powell, W.W., (1997) Trust and Third-party Ties, , Unpublished manuscript, Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago; Cyert, R., March, J.G., (1992) A Behavioral Theory of the Firm, 2d Ed., , New York: Blackwell; Dore, R., Goodwill and the spirit of market capitalism (1983) British Journal of Sociology, 34, pp. 459-482; Emirbayer, M., Goodwin, J., Network analysis, culture, and the problem of agency (1994) American Journal of Sociology, 99, pp. 1411-1454; Friedman, M., (1953) Essays in Positive Economics, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Gerlach, M.L., (1992) Alliance Capitalism: The Social Organization of Japanese Business, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Ghoshal, S., Moran, P., Bad for practice: A critique of the transaction cost theory (1996) Academy of Management Review, 21, pp. 13-47; Glaser, B.G., Strauss, A., (1967) The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, , New York: Aldine; Granovetter, M., Economic action and social structure: The problem of embeddedness (1985) American Journal of Sociology, 91, pp. 481-510; Swedberg, R., The nature of economic relationships (1993) Exploration in Economic Sociology, pp. 3-41. , New York: Russell Sage; Harrison, B., (1994) Lean and Mean: The Changing Landscape of Corporate Power in the Age of Flexibility, , New York: Basic Books; Helper, S., Comparative supplier relations in the U.S. And Japanese auto industries: An exit voice approach (1990) Business Economic History, 19, pp. 153-162; Hirschman, A.O., (1970) Exit, Voice and Loyalty: Responses of Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Rival interpretation of market society: Civilizing, destructive or feeble?
