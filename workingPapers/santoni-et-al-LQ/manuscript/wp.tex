\section{What is an exogenous shock?}
\label{sec:what_exogenous_shocks}

\subsection{Exogenous shocks in the literature on natural experiments}
\label{subsec:exogenous_shocks_and_ne}

\noindent The literature on natural experiments offers several elements to
appreciate the conceptual category of `exogenous shocks' (\cite[for an overview
of the natural experiment design, see for example][]{withers_li_2021,
dunning_2012,craig_et_al_2017,keele_et_al_2016}; \cite[for a review of the
application of this design, see][]{sekhon_titiunik_2012,sieweke_santoni_2020,
roseinzweig_et_al_2000}). Particularly, the extant works draw a line between an
exogenous shock and the interrelated but distinct concept of naturally-occurring
event. While one can observe events such as diplomatic crises, institutional
reforms, or terrorist attacks, exogenous shocks are situated in abstract models
that illustrate how economic and social formations work in the real world
\parencite{morgan_2012}. In other words, impactful naturally-occurring events,
such as Covid-19 global pandemic, could be challenging to fit within a model of
interest and, therefore, do not lead to any exogenous shock. At the same time, a
certain event could provide multiple models with an exogenous shock.  For
example, the reunification of Eastern Germany and Western Germany has been
exploited to address diverse research questions, including the impact of income
on health \parencite[e.g.][]{frijters_et_al_2004}, the transmission of
preferences for entrepreneurship from parents to children
\parencite[e.g.][]{wyrwich_2015}, or the legitimation of inequality
\parencite[e.g.][]{haack_sieweke_2018}.

Figure \ref{fig:event_rq_mapping} pictorially depicts the idea that exogenous 
shocks emerge from purposive associations of naturally-occurring events, which
create the `variance' that is necessary to test a model with observational data,
and research questions. The nature of these associations can be substantive 
--- when the environmental variation becomes an integral part of a study's 
theorizing ---, empirical --- if an analyst exploits the variation to deal with
endogeneity concerns --- or entail a combination of substantive and
empirical elements.

  \includegraphics[width=0.075\textwidth]{exhibits/event_rq_mapping_1.pdf}
   = substantive relevance.}
  \label{fig:event_rq_mapping}
\end{figure}

%% substantive relevance
The lack of \textit{substantive relevance} is one of the most common terrains in which
naturally-occurring events are criticized. For instance, in his critical
analysis of Instrumental Variable (IV) applications,\footnote{It is commonly
accepted that natural experiments' forms include the `Instrumental Variable'
design along with the `Standard Natural Experiment' and `Regression
Discontinuity Design,'  constitutes the three forms of natural experiments
\parencite{sieweke_santoni_2020,dunning_2012}.} the prominent economist
Deaton \parencite*{deaton_2009} observes that:

\begin{quote}
\textit{
  ``[omitted] randomized evaluations of projects are useful for obtaining a convincing
  estimate of the average effect of a program or project. The price for this
  success is a focus that is too narrow to tell us `what works' in development,
  to design policy, or to advance scientific knowledge about development
  processes.''
  }
  (page 3)
\end{quote}

Hence, he argues:

\begin{quote}
   \textit{
  ``[omitted] the analysis of programs or project needs to be refocused towards
  the investigation of potentially generalizable mechanisms that explain why and
  in what contexts projects can be expected to work. The best of the
  experimental work in development economics already does so, because its
  practitioners are too talented to be bound by their own methodological
  prescriptions. Yet there would be much to be said for doing so more openly. I
  concur with the general message in Pawson and Tilley (1997), who argue that
  thirty years of project evaluation in sociology, education and criminology was
  largely unsuccessful because it focused on whether projects work instead of on
  why they work.''
  }
  (page 4)
\end{quote}

Coming from an econometric background, Heckaman and Urzua
\parencite*{heckman_urzua_2010} share Deaton's concerns about IV as a lever to
approximate the experimental ideal:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``The problem that plagues the IV approach is that the questions it answers are
  usually defined as probability limits of estimators and not by well-formulated
  economic problems. Unspecified `effects' replace clearly defined economic
  parameters as the objects of empirical interest.''
  }
  (page 28)
\end{quote}

In his comprehensive work on natural experiments, Dunning 
\parencite*{dunning_2012} pragmatically points out:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``[omitted] the causes that Nature deigns to assign at random may not always be
  the most important causal variables for social scientists. For some observers,
  the proliferation of natural experiments therefore implies the narrowing of
  research agendas to focus on substantively uninteresting or theoretically
  irrelevant topics.''
  }
  (page 3)
\end{quote}

A positive example showing how to turn a naturally-occurring event into a shock
with substantive relevance is Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti's
\parencite*{miguel_et_al_2004} study of the effect of economic growth on civil
war in Africa. Thanks to the ingenious choice to consider weather change data,
the authors broaden the conversation on institutions and economic growth.
Particularly, rainfall variations facilitate an IV design that copes with
longstanding endogeneity issues regarding the co-evolution of institutions and
macroeconomic factors. Hence, the authors can investigate empirically a fresh
and important theoretical relationship, namely, the effect of economic growth on
the likelihood of civil war. 

%% potential outcome framework
Regarding the \textit{empirical relevance} of a naturally-occurring event, the
literature on natural experiments shows a strict view: an event qualifies as an
exogenous shock if and only if it allows to operate a research design with
control group \parencite[][]{cook_et_al_2002}. In other words, there should be
an adequate time window\footnote{We discuss the temporal aspects of exogeneous
shocks' effects in Section \ref{sec:how_exogenous_shocks_differ} and Section
\ref{sec:harnessing_exogenous_shocks}.} in which the intervention $T$ emerging
from the exogenous shock affects a fraction a population's units only.  Such a
condition is \textit{sine qua non} to evaluate the impact of the intervention
using Neyman's potential outcome framework \parencite*{neyman_et_al_1923}, an
unbiased estimator of the average causal effect $T - C$ that is based on three
quantities: (1) $\widehat{T}$, the average response, if all subjects were assigned
to treatment; (2) $\widehat{C}$, the average response, if all subjects were assigned
to control; and (3) the difference $\hat{T} - \widehat{C}$.

The study of John Snow of London's cholera out-break of 1853-54\footnote{The
project of Snow --- aiming to prove that cholera did not transmit through the
air, the so called `miasma hypothesis'--- developed along two arms: he used
geospatial visualizations to show that attacks clustered around Broad Street
water pump in London's Soho district; then, he conducted the standard natural
experiment briefly summarized that we briefly summarize in the main text.}
emphasizes the importance of using exogenous shocks that heterogeneously affect
the units of a population. In 1852, the Lambeth Waterworks company --- one of
the major utility companies supplying water to several parts of the city ---
relocated their water works from Hungerford Market to fifteen mile upstream in
the Thames, thereby \textit{``obtaining a supply of water quite free from the
sewage of London''} \parencite[][page 68]{snow_1855}. Contrarily, Southwark \&
Vauxhall, a company competing with Lambeth Waterworks in several districts of
London, left its intake pipe downstream in the Thames at Battersea. Snow
obtained records on cholera deaths in households throughout London, as well as
information on the company that provided water to each household and the total
number of houses served by each company. Figure
\ref{fig:snow_natural_experiment} reports one of the most compelling pieces of
empirical evidence included the study: fatal attacks are compared before and
after the exogenous shock (Lambeth Waterworks moved their intake pipelines in
1952) and by water supply (see the column reported on the far-right hand section
of the table). Consistently with Neyman model, the analyses of Snow disentangle
the `true' effect of the shock on cholera communication from time invariant
attributes regarding the households served by different water suppliers, and,
perhaps more importantly, from the time variant factors such as the state of the
cholera out-break at different points in time. Should the naturally-occurring
event affected the totality of households in London, unlikely Snow's work would
have addressed the problem of confounders convincingly.

    Snow `On the mode of communication of cholera' \parencite*{snow_1855}. The

    Lambeth Waterworks moved their intake pipes in 1952 --- for treated 
    and control households.}

  \end{small}
\end{figure}

%% sudden? out of control?
A related but distinct aspect of \textit{empirical relevance} concerns the
`exogenous' nature of the naturally-occurring variation. The literature on
natural experiment emphasizes that relevant events are not necessarily sudden,
such as the death of a business leader because of hearth attack
\parencite[e.g.,][]{nguyen_et_al_2010},\footnote{The identification of sudden
deaths poses definition issues
\parencite[e.g.,][]{azoulay_et_al_2010,oettl_2012}.  In the interest of
consistency, Nguyen and Nielsen \parencite*{nguyen_et_al_2010} report they
\textit{``rely on the medical literature, which defines sudden death as an
unexpected and non-traumatic death that occurs instantaneously or within a few
hours of an abrupt change in the person’s previous clinical state.''} The causes
of sudden deaths they consider are `hearth attack,' `stroke,' and `accident or
murder.' In addition to such deaths, they consider also \textit{``accidental 
and traumatic deaths that are unanticipated by the stock market and unrelated to
firm conditions''} (page 553). } uncontrollable, such as earthquakes
\parencite[e.g.,][]{belloc_et_al_2016}, or random, such as lotteries
\parencite[e.g.][]{poulos_2019}.  In fact, extant studies show that both legal
changes and policy interventions can be purposefully used as exogenous shocks to
address certain research questions \parencite[e.g.,][]{beaman_et_al_2012,
matsa_miller_2013,chauchard_2014}. Dunning \parencite*[][page 236]{dunning_2012}
advances a three-step procedure to assess whether a naturally-occurring event
can be plausibly considered exogenous or `as-if random'. First, researchers
should investigate whether units had information that they would or would not
receive the treatment. Second, researchers need to check whether units had
incentives to self-select into the treatment group or control group. Third,
researchers should analyze whether not only units had incentives but also
capacity to self-select into a treatment status. For the assessment, Dunning
\parencite*{dunning_2012} suggests using both qualitative evidence (e.g.,
documents, interviews) and quantitative evidence (e.g., balance tests).

For example, Snow \parencite*{snow_1855} presented various sorts of evidence to
establish the pre-treatment equivalence of the houses that were exposed to pure
and contaminated sources of water supply. His own description is most eloquent:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``The mixing of the (water) supply is of the most intimate kind. The pipes of
  each Company go down all the streets, and into nearly all the courts and
  alleys. A few houses are supplied by one Company and a few by the other,
  according to the decision of the owner or occupier at that time when the Water
  Companies were in active competition. In many cases a single house has a
  supply different from that on either side. Each company supplies both rich and
  poor, both large houses and small; there is no difference either in the
  condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different
  Companies\ldots It is obvious that no experiment could have been devised which
  would more thoroughly test the effect of water supply on the progress of
  cholera than this.''
  }
  \parencite[][pages 74–75]{snow_1855}
\end{quote}

At the same time, qualitative information on context and on the process that
determined water-supply source was also crucial in Snow's study. For instance,
Snow emphasized that decisions regarding which of the competing water companies
would be chosen for a particular address were often taken by absentee landlords.
Thus, residents did not largely `self-select' into their source of water
supply --- so confounding characteristics of residents appeared unlikely to
explain the large differences in death rates by company (see Figure
\ref{fig:snow_natural_experiment}). Moreover, the decision of the Lambeth
company to move its intake pipe upstream on the Thames was taken before the
cholera outbreak of 1853–54, and existing scientific knowledge did not clearly
link water source to cholera risk. As Snow puts it, the move of the Lambeth
company's water pipe meant that more than 300,000 people of all ages and social
strata were

\begin{quote}
  \textit{``divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, 
  without their knowledge; one group being supplied with water containing the 
  sewage of London, and, amongst it, whatever might have come from the cholera 
  patients, the other group having water quite free from such impurity.''}
  \parencite[][pages 74–75]{snow_1855}
\end{quote}

Drawing on the methodological insights included in Snow's study, Figure 
\ref{fig:exogeneous_shocks_and_ne} illustrates visually the idea that either
events that are unknown/unknowable to units and events that are known to units
can provide scholars with an exogenous variation suited to address the research 
question at hand. However, `known events' may raise themselves endogeneity concerns
regarding the possibility for a unit to affect the direction and magnitude of a 
naturally-occurring variation and/or to self-select into the treatment 
or control group.

\subsection{Exogenous shocks in leadership and management research}
\label{subsec:exogenous_shocks_in_management}

\noindent In order to understand how management scholars conceptualize and use
exogenous shocks, we conducted a systematic survey of the literature. 
Consistently with recently published reviews 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{gonzalez_et_al_2018,rindova_et_al_2018}, we restricted our
search to a selection of prominent journals such as Academy of Management
Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice,
Journal of Business Ethics, Journal of Business Venturing, Journal of
Management, Journal of Management Studies, The Leadership Quarterly, Management
Science, Organization Science, Organization Studies, Research Policy, Strategic
Entrepreneurship Journal, Strategic Management Journal, Strategic Organization.
Using Scopus, we retrieved articles published up until December 31, 2021
that present the bi-gram `exogenous shock*,' in the title, abstract, \emph{or} set of
author's generated keywords. The search resulted in 49 unique items.
\footnote{Data were retrieved on January 17, 2022.}

Having considered the full manuscript of each retrieved articles, we discarded
18 articles that did not fall within the remit of the review. Particularly, 
we excluded from the sample two studies in which the search token appears once and 
appears not to focus on or use the conceptual category of `exogenous shock'
\parencite{uzzi199735,kriauciunas2006659}; one work focusing on managers'
cognitive representation of a shock \parencite{barreto2013687}; four non-empirical papers
\parencite[e.g.,][]{mcsweeney2009933}; two qualitative studies
\parencite{glynn20051031, jenkins2010884}; one field experiment 
\parencite{cui20191216}; eight Management Science articles dealing with

Two authors independently coded the retained studies against the dimensions 
included in Figure \ref{fig:event_rq_mapping}, that is, (1) the exploited 
naturally-occurring event (e.g., 9/11, Sarbane-Oxley Act); (2) the leading
research question (e.g., `how do changes in an employee's relational capital
influence mobility and entrepreneurship decisions?'); and (3) the relationship
between (1) and (2), which can be substantive --- when the exogenous shock is an
integral part of the research question/plays a key role for theorizing 
--- or empirical --- when one leverages an environmental variation to cope
with the problem of confounders, but the exogenous shock is unrelated with the
substantive scope of the study --- or both. Having completed the independent 
analysis of sample studies, the two authors merged their coding choices and 
reconciled their different views regarding the role of the exogenous shock play
in four papers.\footnote{The coding spreadsheet is publicly available at: \href{
https://www.dropbox.com/s/rzz0kb7hjoe4ec9/coded_studies.csv?dl=0}
{https://www.dropbox.com/.../coded\_studies.xlsx?dl=0}.} Table
\ref{tab:summary_of_sample_studies} reports the outcome of our coding, including
a brief summary of how the naturally-occurring event qualifies as an exogenous
shock (see the column `Summary', reported on the right-hand side of the table).

Regarding the first dimension of our coding, the most popular categories of 
events are `legal change' and (N = 11) and `turnover' (N = 6) --- see Figure 
\ref{fig:classes_of_events}. Concerning `legal change,' scholars have relied on
events such as the staggered passage of anti-takeover laws 
\parencite{cabral202128,wang20162393}, change in immigration rules 
\parencite{choudhury2019203}, the Garn-St. Germain Act
\parencite{haveman2001253}, the Sarbane-Oxley Act \parencite{gupta2020802},
SEC's regulation change \parencite{jia2020290}, the change of inheritance, gift,
and estate taxes \parencite{kang20201300}, the staggered adoption of the
Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine in U.S.  \parencite{kang20201300}, a revision of
U.S. Higher Education Amendments \parencite{krishnan20194522}, reductions in
import tariffs \parencite{li20194011}, demonetization measures
\parencite{natarajan20191070}.  Turnover events comprise sick leave episodes of
key employees \parencite{chen20181239,drexler20142722,chown2015177,}, political
leadership churn \parencite{birhanu2020,byun20191368}, and sudden deaths
of executives \parencite{ke2019439}. Other recurrent events include terrorist
attacks \parencite{corbo2016323,vergne20121027,li20194011} and scandals
\parencite{cai2019159,hilary2021}, and change in financial analysts' coverage
\parencite{chatterji2010917,qian20192271}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \import{}{exhibits/classes_of_events.pgf}
    \caption{Classes of naturally-occurring events presumed to create 
    exogenous shocks.}
    \label{fig:classes_of_events}
\end{figure}

As shown in the Venn diagram included in Figure \ref{fig:event_roles},
naturally-occurring events are claimed to play an empirical role in the large majority
of the cases included in our sample (N = 25). For instance, Krishnan and 
Wang \parencite*{krishnan20194522} use data from the Survey of Consumer 
Finances to address the research question
`does student debt influence the propensity to start a firm?'. The concept 
of exogenous shock is not important for the scope of the work 
and does not inform the proposed theorizing. At the same time, one may study
the relationship between student debt and business creation in the context of 
an observational research design. However, the authors are concerned about 
the causal interpretation of their empirical estimates:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``there may be unobserved characteristics that may drive our results. For
  instance, individuals with wealthier families may have lower student debt as
  well as the financial means to start a firm. Such unobservable family effects
  may explain the negative relation between student debt and entrepreneurship.
  Alternatively, individuals from wealthier families may borrow more if they
  expect to be able to pay back the loans easily (and such individuals are more
  likely to be entrepreneurs).''
  }
  (page 4528)
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \import{}{exhibits/event_roles.pgf}
    \caption{Role of the naturally-occurring events presumed to create exogenous shocks.}
    \label{fig:event_roles}
\end{figure}

Hence, they use a legal change as an exogenous shock to the cost of business 
failures for individuals with greater levels of student loans:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
  ``To address endogeneity concerns, we utilize the Higher Education Amendments
  (HEA) of 1998, which effectively rendered student loans completely
  non-dischargeable. We find that students that were already in four-year college
  at the time of this regulation and had significant student debt were less
  likely to start a firm. This test considers only individuals who were enrolled
  prior to the year of regulation (i.e., prior to 1998) in a four-year college.
  The idea is that, for the group of individuals who are already enrolled in
  college, the regulatory change is clearly exogenous, in the sense that it
  does not drive their choice to enter college. ''
  }
  (page 4532)
\end{quote}

Half of the studies circa (N = 16) assign a substantive role to exogenous
shocks.  For example, Haveman, Russo and Meyer \parencite*{haveman2001253} 
articulate a framework that links organizations' responses to discontinuous
industry-level, regulatory change. The theoretical section of the study maps the
phenomenon of regulatory change onto the General Punctuated Equilibrium Model
and provides expectations about the multiple consequences of regulatory change
for individual organizations. The substantive role of the shock is self-evident
in the formulation of the hypotheses, e.g.:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Immediately following any regulatory punctuation, CEO succession rates
    will not rise; instead, CEO succession rates will rise gradually as time
    passes.''
  }
  (page 259)
\end{quote}

It is worth to notice the authors emphasize the `exogenous' nature of the Garn-St.
Germain Act --- the example of regulatory change at the center of the paper 
---, but they do not discuss what it means for the research design of 
the study, and, especially, in terms of empirical identification.

We also found a subset of studies (N = 8) that claim to use an exogenous with
empirical and substantive relevance. Byun, Raffaele, and Ganco
\parencite{byun20191368} propose a set of hypothesis that connect `discontinuous
increases in the value of an employee's relational capital' with `employee
turnover' and `spinout' formation. For example, their first hypothesis states:

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Discontinuous increases in the value of an  employee's relational capital 
    will be positively related to employee exit.''
  }
  (page 1371)
\end{quote}

The authors can advance and test this and the other hypotheses thanks to
naturally-occuring events regarding the politicians connected to lobbyists
(i.e., `employees').  Here is a passage concerning the description of the
independent variable of the study, `discontinuous increases in the value of an
employee's relational capital:'

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``We use appointments to committee chair and assignments to the four most
    powerful committees in Congress to capture connected politicians' power
    changes in the legislative process. Discontinuous increase is a binary
    variable coded `1' for the first year a politician connected to a lobbyist is
    selected to be a chair of a congressional committee or is assigned to one of
    the powerful committees in Congress and `0' otherwise.''
  }
  (page 1375)
\end{quote}

The series of political appointment decisions play also an empirical role, the 
Byun and colleagues point out: 

\begin{quote}
  \textit{
    ``Our identifying assumption is consistent with prior work and rests on the
    notion that the temporal change in power of connected politicians is
    exogenous, conditional on the observable characteristics of the lobbyists
    and their firms [omitted]. For the power change of a connected politician to
    be plausibly exogenous, whether and when the connected politician will
    experience the advancement has to be difficult to predict by lobbyists and
    firms. In addition, the change in lobbyist's value creation due to a surge
    in the value of political connections should be uncorrelated with the
    accumulation of the lobbyist's expertise, conditional on observables. Given
    the complicated and uncertain political process of chair selection and
    committee assignment, scholars have argued that committee and chair
    assignment satisfies these conditions with respect to lobbyists [omitted].
    In fact, others have gone as far as to argue that the timing and ascension
    of committee and chair appointments are exogenous even to the politician
    herself [omitted]. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that using the power
    change of a connected politician to capture discontinuous in-creases in the
    lobbyist's relational capital would alleviate identification concerns due to
    potential omitted variable biases.''

Figure \ref{fig:potential_outcome} illustrates the distribution of sample studies

the articles (N = 11) operate a research design without control group. For
example, Corbo, Ferriani, and Corrado \parencite*{corbo2016323} use 9/11 
as a shock for the logics behind the formation of alliances in the airline industry.

\label{sec:harnessing_exogenous_shocks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Environmental change - theory mapping
\item Temporal effects / timeline within which one expects the effects of the exogenous shock takes place
\item Scope to influence regulator's choices?
\item Time to react to regulator's choices?
\item Does a staggered adoption of legislative change correlate with admin/state-level features?
\item Exogenous shocks may have consequences that span multiple levels of analysis (e.g., sudden deaths of business owners)
\item Strategic purposes might lead the exogenous shock — entities that are treated might be passive — however, the policy maker may have incentives to treat certain entities
\item Conditional exogeneity (exogeneity within a statistical model sounds weird)
\item The nature of regulatory changes should be investigated from a multi-level perspective
\item Opportunities to marry the theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of shocks
\item Regulatory change — information, incentives, and capacity elements should be assessed before and after the introduction of the new law.
\item Scale of the shock and availabilities of counterfactualsThe
