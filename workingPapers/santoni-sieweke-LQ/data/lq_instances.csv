1280,"Watts L.L., Steele L.M., Mumford M.D.",Making sense of pragmatic and charismatic leadership stories: Effects on vision formation,Leadership Quarterly,2019,"For some time, it has been argued that stories articulated by leaders are an important vehicle for exercising influence, but stories of leadership might also serve as a means for developing leadership potential. One critical activity involved in leadership is vision formation, which involves constructing and communicating a future state that guides followers in “making sense” of complex organizational events. Like leader visions, analyzing stories also, by nature, evokes sensemaking processes. As a result, analyzing stories of leadership may provide a natural means for practicing the art of sensemaking. In the present investigation, undergraduates were asked to read six short stories about incidents of either pragmatic or charismatic leadership in business settings. After reading each story, questions were asked to encourage sensemaking of story events, causes, and emotions. Participants were subsequently asked to formulate visions for leading a secondary school –– a transfer task. It was found that stronger visions were produced when participants were asked to analyze both story events and the causes of these events. The implications of these findings for the use of leadership stories in leader development initiatives are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Leader development; Leadership; Sensemaking; Stories; Vision,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053359999&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2018.09.003&partnerID=40&md5=466fb053882b5828c45ab0fbf5f9e58e
1279,"Watkins T., Fehr R., He W.",Whatever it takes: Leaders' perceptions of abusive supervision instrumentality,Leadership Quarterly,2019,"In this paper we examine how leaders' perceptions of the instrumental benefits of abusive supervision shape their tendencies to abuse their employees. We posit that leaders who believe abuse has a positive impact on employee performance will engage in more abusive supervision than their peers, with downstream implications for employees' counterproductive work behaviors. Furthermore, we position leader empathic concern as a boundary condition, whereby empathic concern mitigates the effects of leaders' perceptions of abusive supervision's instrumentality. Data from two studies employing both experimental and field survey designs offer convergent support for our hypotheses. Overall, our findings challenge the prevailing view that abusive supervision is primarily motivated by a desire to aggress, instead demonstrating that leaders sometimes abuse their employees in the pursuit of more pro-organizational goals. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Abusive supervision; Counterproductive behavior; Empathy; Instrumentality,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053138652&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2018.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=25a64ab91735931328e3e24568b3f758
1278,"Stoker J.I., Garretsen H., Soudis D.",Tightening the leash after a threat: A multi-level event study on leadership behavior following the financial crisis,Leadership Quarterly,2019,"This paper presents the results of a multi-level event study of the effects of the 2008 financial crisis on leadership behavior. Following assumptions from the threat-rigidity hypothesis, we expect that across firms and countries, this crisis led to an increase in directive leadership. In line with this hypothesis, we also anticipate that this change is context-specific. The impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the change in directive leadership is analyzed for over 20,000 managers in 980 organizations across 36 countries. We find that the financial crisis went along with a significant increase in directive leadership, and that this effect was stronger in the manufacturing sector, and in countries with a high degree of power distance. Our results support the threat-rigidity hypothesis, and contribute to leadership research by showing that the context is not only a moderator but actually shapes leadership behavior. This opens up a new avenue of leadership research where context is an antecedent of leadership behavior more generally, and where the methodological set-up allows for causal inference. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Directive leadership; Event study; Financial crisis; Multi-level analysis; Threat-rigidity hypothesis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053111229&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2018.08.004&partnerID=40&md5=acb133ff6b9d9b9b0101e59df19f9f97

Role congruity theory suggests that women need to temper their agency with communion in order to emerge as leaders. We investigated how ascriptions of agentic and communal characteristics were related to leadership emergence by analyzing data collected from women's leadership contests in 2 consecutive years. Participants worked in groups on assessment-center-like tasks (Study 1: N = 184). After each task, they identified individuals with leadership potential and described these individuals' characteristics. Raters categorized these characteristics as agentic or communal. Response surface analyses showed curvilinear effects of perceived agency and perceived communion on leadership emergence, indicating that women who tempered their agency with communion were most likely to emerge as leaders.

PL is conceptualized as the simultaneous enactment of two seemingly paradoxical leadership behaviors: 1) benevolence – the holistic and genuine care for followers’ well-being even outside the workplace, and 2) authority – non-exploitative use of behaviors that emphasize power and control based on status and hierarchy. Results from 165 independent samples from 152 studies (total N = 68,395) in fourteen countries demonstrate a consistently divergent pattern across the dimensions. Even in societies where PL is presumed to be more prevalent and acceptable, the strong control (authoritarianism) dimension is consistently negatively related to task performance, citizenship behaviors, creativity, attitudes towards the leader, and job attitudes. Conversely, the benevolence dimension demonstrates consistently positive relationships with leader effectiveness and follower performance, attitudes, and behaviors. The most commonly used measure of PL includes a morality dimension, which produces positive effects similar to the benevolence dimension. Collectively, PL dimensions (as well as a separate unitary measure of PL emphasizing benevolence) predict incremental variance beyond transformational leadership and beyond LMX. Based on conceptual and empirical grounds, it appears that PL (especially benevolence) is not fully captured in mainstream approaches to leadership and may add value to our understanding of the universe of ways leadership can be enacted. Several directions for future research are discussed, including the need to study the rarely-examined interactions between benevolence and authority, in line with the core of PL theory. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057808487&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2018.11.003&partnerID=40&md5=9556505d2cd487fca943ad88edb879a6

1282,"Bastardoz N., Van Vugt M.",The nature of followership: Evolutionary analysis and review,Leadership Quarterly,2019,"From an evolutionary perspective, followership is puzzling because it is not clear why individuals would relinquish their autonomy and set aside their personal goals to follow those of another individual, the leader. This paper analyzes followership from an evolutionary perspective and advances three main conclusions that are not yet part of the leadership literature. First, followership evolved as a strategy to solve a range of cooperation and coordination problems in groups (e.g., collective movement, peacekeeping). Second, individuals who lack the physical, psychological, or social capital to be leaders themselves are more likely to emerge as followers. Third, followership styles, behaviors, and engagement result from (a) variations in the relative pay-offs that accrue to followers vis-à-vis their leader, (b) the adaptive goals pursued by followers, (c) the adaptive challenges that select for different followership styles, and (d) the prevailing leadership style.

Furthermore, because workgroup characteristics have potential implications on the relationship between a deal grantor and the deal recipient, drawing upon social identity theory of leadership, we reason that the i-deals-LMX relationship is affected by the overall value congruence among the group members.

How leaders deal with pre-existing friendships,Leadership Quarterly,2018,"We studied employees who were promoted into a leadership role from within their workgroup and explored how they dealt, psychologically, with being both a leader and a friend of their subordinates. In an inductive, qualitative study of 33 individuals from across three organizations (two mining companies and one childcare organization) we found that these people experienced psychological conflict that resulted in them feeling vulnerable to being exploited or being afraid to use their power over subordinate-friends. We identified five strategies that were used, namely abdicating responsibility, ending the friendship, establishing the divide, overlapping the roles, and using friendship to lead. We developed a model whereby the type of psychological conflict and the person's leader identity (either “the boss”, just a role, or a weak or non-existent leader identity) leads to the choice of resolution strategy. This exploration into understanding pre-existing friendships demonstrates the ongoing need to consider those in a leadership role as “people” and not just “leaders”. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Conflict; Friendship; Leader identity; Leadership; Power,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050110624&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2018.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=7dde515d8a601b97657c61de1acf9e51

However, research on ethical leadership has failed to examine the active role that followers' attributes play in enhancing or minimizing the influence of ethical leadership in organizational outcomes. We applied the substitutes for leadership approach (Kerr & Jermier, 1978) to ethical leadership and predicted that proactive personality acts as substitute in the relationship between ethical leadership, workplace emotions and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). Data from two distinct samples offered strong support for the hypotheses. Specifically, we found that ethical leadership was significantly and negatively related to negative workplace emotions when subordinate proactive personality was low, but not when it was high, with consequences for OCBs. These findings suggest that proactive personality constitutes an important moderator on the impact of low ethical leadership on workplace emotions, with consequences for OCBs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Ethical leadership; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Proactive personality; Substitutes for leadership; Workplace emotions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049631277&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2018.06.004&partnerID=40&md5=ad253f2a7341149e1b87c45a2fea646a

Benevolence-dominant paternalistic leadership refers to leaders' sole dependence on the use of benevolence without their strong assertion of authority, whereas authoritarianism-dominant paternalistic leadership is based mainly on authoritarianism itself; classical paternalistic leadership, which best fits early observations of paternalistic leaders, refers to the salient combination of both leadership components. We used two distinct samples and methods to test this typology and the association with subordinate performance. Across the two studies, a field investigation with Taiwanese military supervisor-subordinate dyads and a hypothetical scenario experiment with U.S. working adults, we found a positive relationship between classical paternalistic leadership and subordinate performance as strong as that between benevolence-dominant paternalistic leadership and performance.

We present a model of authentic leadership that looks at it, not as a leadership style, but as an outcome of a legitimation process. Authentic leadership represents legitimated follower perceptions of a leader's authenticity which are activated by moral judgments. We explain how a follower-centered assessment of the moral component helps explain leadership dynamics in situations involving ethical relativism, thus alleviating concerns regarding the presumed moral component of the construct. The overlap between leaders' and followers' value systems leads to impressions of authenticity, even in cases in which there are no clear universal moral standards. An authentic person's behavior cannot be labeled as “leadership” unless it is embraced by a follower who grants moral legitimacy to the leader.

The type of inference shapes the effectiveness of leader anger expressions,Leadership Quarterly,2018,"Existing leadership research has presented conflicting views on the effects of leader anger expressions. The present research aims to reconcile these findings by proposing that the type of inferences followers make (i.e., motivation-focused inference or trait-focused inference) is a key factor determining the outcomes of leader anger expressions. Through one survey study (Study 1) and two experimental studies (Studies 2 and 3), the present research indicates that the effectiveness of leader anger expressions is associated with the type of inferences followers draw from the anger. In general, we found support for the negative relationship between trait-focused inferences and leader effectiveness, but were unable to properly test the positive relationship between motivation-focused inferences and leader effectiveness due to the lack of appropriate instrumental variables. We also investigated whether followers' implicit theories of personality (i.e., entity versus incremental theory) would moderate the effect of leader anger expressions on the type of inferences made by followers, which in turn shapes leader effectiveness. The results of Study 3 provide evidence of the moderating role of implicit theories of personality.

We build on this approach by unpacking the role leader identity plays in the leader emergence process. Taking the perspective that leadership is a dynamic social process between group members, we propose a social network-based process model whereby leader role identity predicts network centrality (i.e., betweenness and indegree), which then contributes to leader emergence. We test our model using a sample of 88 cadets participating in a leadership development training course. In support of our model, cadets who possess a stronger leader role identity at the beginning of the course were more likely to emerge as leaders. However this relationship was only mediated by one form of network centrality, indegree centrality, reflecting one's ability to build relationships within one's group.

However, we still know little about why some women cope with the tensions between agency and communion better than others and what implications are involved. Using a paradox perspective, we develop a theoretical model to explain how women leaders experience and respond to agency-communion tensions, which impacts their intrapersonal and interpersonal outcomes. Specifically, we propose that in response to experiencing tensions fueled by the dual demands for agency and communion, women leaders can adopt a paradox mindset that simultaneously embraces agency and communion, or a dilemma mindset that dichotomizes agency and communion. The paradox mindset helps women leaders build psychological resilience, identity coexistence, and leadership effectiveness, whereas those who adopt a dilemma mindset experience depleted resilience, identity separation, and lowered leadership effectiveness. Further, our model highlights individual, interpersonal, and organizational conditions that shape women's experience and stimulate a paradox mindset versus a dilemma mindset.

The effect of top-level female leadership on subordinate females,Leadership Quarterly,2018,"We investigate the effect of female leadership on gender differences in public and private organizations. Female leadership impact was constructed using a quasi-experiment involving mayoral elections, and our research used a sample of 8.3 million organizations distributed over 5600 Brazilian municipalities. Our main results show that when municipalities in which a woman was elected leader (treatment group) are compared with municipalities in which a male was elected leader (control group) there was an increase in the number of top and middle female managers in public organizations. Two aspects contribute to the results: time and command/role model. The time effect is important because our results are obtained with reelected women – in their second term – and the command/role model (the queen bee phenomenon is either small, or non-existent) is important because of the institutional characteristics of public organizations: female leaders (mayor) have much asymmetrical power and decision-making discretion, i.e., she chooses the top managers. These top managers then choose middle managers influenced by female leadership (a role model). We obtained no significant results for private organizations. Our work contributes to the literature on leadership by addressing some specific issues: an empirical investigation with a causal effect between the variables (regression-discontinuity design – a non-parametric estimation), the importance of role models, and how the observed effects are time-dependent. Insofar as public organizations are concerned, the evidence from our large-scale study suggests that the queen bee phenomenon may be a myth; instead, of keeping subordinate women at bay, our results show that women leaders who are afforded much managerial discretion behave in a benevolent manner toward subordinate women. The term “Regal Leader” instead of “Queen Bee” is thus a more appropriate characterization of women in top positions of power. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044929008&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2018.03.002&partnerID=40&md5=3d4c26c00654e7eae226792de32a8c04

Facial appearance predicted leadership emergence but not effectiveness. Personality had a more nuanced relationship with leadership outcomes.

The present research advances theoretical understanding by testing the assertion that high RI with the leader drives follower mobilization of effort and psychophysiological responses to stress. Two experimental scenario studies (Study 1 and Study 2) support the hypothesis that being led by an individual with whom followers perceive high RI increases follower intentional mobilization. Study 2 additionally showed that high (vs. low) RI increases follower resource appraisals and cognitive task performance. A laboratory experiment (Study 3) assessing cardiovascular (CV) reactivity showed that, compared to neutral (i.e., non-affiliated) leadership, being led by an individual with whom participants felt low RI elicited a maladaptive (i.e., threat) response to a pressurized task. In addition, relative to the low RI and neutral conditions, high RI with the leader did not engender greater challenge or threat reactivity. In conclusion, advancing social identity leadership and challenge and threat theory, findings suggest that leaders should be mindful of the deleterious effects (i.e., reduced mobilization and greater threat state) of low RI to optimize follower mobilization of effort and psychophysiological responses to stress. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Appraisal; Followership; Social identity; Stress,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028363519&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2017.08.003&partnerID=40&md5=115ac7a4bc5564aa6de29ae90bc967da

In the current study we show that narcissistic CEO's subject their organizations to undue legal risk because they are overconfident about their ability to win and less sensitive to the costs to their organizations of such litigation. Using a sample of 32 firms, we find that those led by narcissistic CEOs are more likely to be involved in litigation and that these lawsuits are more protracted. In two follow-up experimental studies, we examine the mechanism underlying the relationship between narcissism and lawsuits and find that narcissists are less sensitive to objective assessments of risk when making decisions about whether to settle a lawsuit and less willing to take advice from experts.

This meta-analysis investigates whether leader-observer agreement is influenced by type of observer and type of leadership. First, we examined the convergence (i.e., correlation) between leader- and observer-ratings along several dimensions of leadership (e.g., initiating structure, consideration, contingent reward, and transformational leadership). Our results indicated that leader-observer correlations were generally moderate and of similar magnitudes for task- and relation-oriented behaviors (with the exception of a strong correlation for contingent reward). Next, we compared leaders’ and observers’ mean-level ratings (i.e., Cohen's d), and found that leaders generally reported lower or similar levels of task-oriented behaviors but higher levels of relation-oriented behaviors.

However, its consequences for the leaders themselves remain largely unexamined. This is problematic, as organizations require their leaders to provide guidance and leaders’ mental well-being is a prerequisite for this.

In an experience sampling study, we apply hierarchical linear modeling to analyze 396 observations from 44 executives. Our multilevel moderated mediation analyses reveal that authentic leadership reduces leaders’ stress and increases their work engagement and that these effects are mediated by leader mental depletion.

In a study that integrates principles of servant leadership with the social comparison theoretical framework, we tested a group-level model to examine how servant leadership induces low perceived differentiation in leader-member relationship quality (perceived LMX differentiation) within a group, which strengthens team cohesion and in turn positively influences team task performance and service-oriented organizational citizenship behaviors (service OCB). Our sample comprised 229 employees nested in 67 work teams. Structural equation modeling results indicate that servant leadership significantly predicts low perceived LMX differentiation; perceived LMX differentiation is strongly related to team cohesion such that the lower the perceived differentiation, the stronger the team's cohesiveness.

In parallel, the management literature urges for agentic “masculine” leadership to turn around organizations in crisis. We hypothesized that, regardless of their gender, agentic leaders should be preferred to communal leaders if leadership qualifications and actual change potential motivate leader selection. Three experimental studies demonstrated that agentic (vs. communal) candidates were perceived to match poorly-performing (vs. strongly-performing) companies. This effect was accounted for by perceptions of agentic candidates' higher suitability, higher task-orientation (versus person-orientation), and higher change potential. We discuss that women face ambiguity as to why they become leaders in crisis contexts: because they are perceived as signaling change, stereotypically linked to their gender, or for their perceived agentic qualities as leaders.

It involves enabling the adaptive process by creating space for ideas advanced by entrepreneurial leaders to engage in tension with the operational system and generate innovations that scale into the system to meet the adaptive needs of the organization and its environment.

Attempts to define and measure charisma have frequently treated it as a complex construct consisting of multiple components. However, little work has been done to develop a theoretical model that offers a parsimonious rationale explaining why certain leadership attributes are considered “charismatic” while others are not, or how these attributes combine to produce charismatic effects. Addressing these issues, we present a model that situates emotion as the primary variable in the charismatic process. We use recent research on the moral emotions to frame a theory of followership-relevant emotions (FREs) that describes how leaders use emotions such as compassion, admiration, and anger to compel their followers to act. We then discuss the Elicit-Channel (EC) model of charismatic leadership, positing that the charismatic relationship is a five-step, cyclical process. In the EC model, leaders elicit highly motivating emotions from their followers and then channel those emotions to produce action that, if successful, results in outcomes such as positive affect and trust. These outcomes then enable the leader to continue the cycle, eliciting emotion once more.

This interest has, however, resulted in a multiplicity of views that have tended to obfuscate rather than clarify the affect-LMX nexus. To deal with this lack of clarity, we conducted a systematic integration of affect-LMX literature published in leading journals since 2000, including the role of personal affectivity, discrete affect, emotional intelligence, emotional labor, and affective climate. We structured our review using a multilevel framework of affect that encompasses five levels of analysis: (1) within-person, (2) between persons, (3) interpersonal, (4) team, and (5) organizational levels; as well as consideration of cross-level effects. We address in particular three fundamental issues that we argue may have hampered the development of the affect-LMX nexus in the literature: theoretical diversity, problems of data analysis, and measurement issues. We conclude by discussing opportunities for future research across the different levels and develop a set of research questions that we hope will help to promote research into the role of affect in LMX. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Affect; Emotions; LMX; Multilevel analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033451881&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2017.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=9b5dca73fe8b392b5ced75027ce9cf12

Followers accept influence from individuals who meet their perceptions of what it means to be a leader, and IM is an important way of impacting those perceptions.

We examine the multi-dimensional nature of IM as a construct composed of information processing, communicative, and goal-directed components, thereby creating eight IM archetypes. Then, we examine how IM can be used to impact follower perceptions of the leader through the lenses of transformational/charismatic, authentic, and leader categorization theories.

Drawing from the central tenets of social dominance and interpersonal interaction theories, we propose that various leader-follower dominance combinations can incite abusive supervision via relationship conflict. We first suggest that when leaders and followers are both high on dominance, relationship conflict is likely to result. Furthermore, we suggest that when leaders and followers have incongruent dominance, relationship conflict is also more likely to occur. Finally, we propose that relationship conflict will mediate the relationship between these congruent and incongruent combinations and abusive supervision. Using polynomial regression and response surface analysis, we found support for our hypotheses, and reveal that both high- and low-dominance leaders are susceptible to conflict and subsequent abuse, depending on their followers’ dominance.

Based on a prospective cohort study of 7719 boys born in 1953, of which 5928 were later drafted, we explored individual differences in leadership emergence in childhood and early adulthood. The data set consisted of register data from different time points and a survey of the cohort in the 6th grade. As expected, cognitive ability, tallness and muscular power were decisive for assessment of military officer suitability. However, we also found a moderate to strong impact on this assessment score from social class, leadership aspirations in childhood, birth order, self-regulatory skills in school, parental support, and previous participation in extracurricular activities. Similarly, social class, cognitive ability, developmental experiences, and birth order were important for nominations as class party organizer in the 6th grade.

An investigation on how leader moral anger influences follower trust,Leadership Quarterly,2018,"Leaders' expression of moral anger is considered important in curbing unethical behaviors and maintaining an ethical environment in organizations, but how it affects follower trust in leaders is unknown. The present research examines how leader anger expression in response to moral transgressions influences follower trust. I propose two paths through which leader moral anger affects follower trust: a character-based path whereby leader moral anger increases follower trust by elevating follower perceived leader integrity, and a relationship-based path whereby leader moral anger decreases follower trust by reducing follower perceived leader benevolence. I further propose that the balance of these mechanisms depends on follower moral orientation (i.e., justice orientation or care orientation). The results from two experimental studies did not provide support for the character-based path, but did provide tentative support for the relationship-based path between leader moral anger and follower affective trust. In addition, the results from the exploratory analyses indicated that leader moral anger had a negative direct effect on follower affective trust but not on follower overall trust.

Research using evolutionary theory shows that citizens instead turn to perceptions of procedural fairness concerning whether leaders follow basic decision-making rules such as passing policies without personal interest and displaying responsiveness to citizens' opinions. Some argue that this helps citizens “weed out” questionable leaders; others question citizens' ability to distinguish those following the rules from those who do not. To address this question, I build on psychological research showing that the mind possesses a natural ability, a cheater-detection system, enabling the detection of self-interested others who violate social rules. Introducing an experimental protocol from psychology embedded in cross-national surveys, I show that this system also operates when citizens evaluate political leaders, facilitating identification of leaders who violate basic decision-making rules.

Whereas traditional approaches suggest that high pay incentivizes leadership, identity-based approaches argue that it can undermine shared identity between leaders and followers and therefore be counterproductive.

What has drawn less attention in the scientific literature is how different levels of resource inequality influence what types of individuals emerge as leaders. In the current paper we take a distal approach to understanding the psychological consequences of inequality and the associated implications for leadership. We describe how the distribution of resources in contrasting animal and small-scale human societies incentivizes dominance-oriented versus prestige-oriented leadership strategies, and we use this framework to tease out a number of implications for modern organizational environments. In particular, we suggest that higher levels of inequality attract and favor dominance-oriented rather than prestige-oriented leaders, and that inequality incentivizes leaders to favor their own self-interest over the interests of the organizations they lead. We describe the features of modern organizations that might facilitate the emergence of dominance-oriented leadership and discuss the downstream consequences for organizations.

These two perspectives, however, have evolved separately. We propose that findings from these separate streams of research can be integrated, and thus a more holistic understanding of CEO succession can be afforded, through focusing on the central factor responsible for their differences—distinct temporal foci of these streams. The disruption perspective suggests CEO succession imposes costs on organizations, which influences short-term performance. The adaptation perspective suggests CEO succession requires time for effects to manifest, which implies a lagged effect on performance. Based on a meta-analysis of 60 samples from 1972 to 2013 representing 13,578 successions, we find CEO succession negatively influences performance in the short-term and has no significant direct influence on long-term performance. Long-term performance effects, instead, are mediated by strategic change and new CEO origin (inside vs. outside the firm). Inside CEOs improve long-term performance and engage in less strategic change, while hiring an outside CEO leads to more strategic change that results in lower long-term performance.

Feedback is an evaluative process, with the (typically higher-power) source often having considerable discretion and means to deliver feedback and the feedback recipient often being at the mercy of the will of the source. The feedback process, therefore, has a built-in power component that preserves and amplifies existing power differences in organizations (e.g., differences in organizational authority and rank) and disproportionately harms women's leadership development. We develop a theoretical model concerning how power retention conditions (e.g., when giving feedback advances the source's personal status goals) lead to power retention mechanisms in the feedback process, such as patronizing feedback, particularly for female recipients. We discuss how gender moderates feedback delivery and reactions to feedback, which influence the persistent gender gap in leadership, subsequently reinforcing the power retention conditions.

In a sample of 107 unique supervisor-subordinate dyads that filled out the online questionnaire, we found that both Agreeableness and Honesty-Humility were negatively related to subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the origins of abusive supervision and hopefully stimulate future research on supervisor personality and abusive supervision. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Abusive supervision; Big Five; HEXACO; Leadership; Personality traits,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011965926&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2017.02.001&partnerID=40&md5=1cf12856c3a6c0218ebb7d6111406eec

Employing grounded theory methods, we uncover how women are likely to experience asymmetry, and discover it becomes most salient during personal and professional identity transitions. We build theory with respect to how women leaders navigate feeling misidentified, and find with time and power the experience becomes less salient.

The more strongly an individual identifies with their employing organization, the more motivated they will be to behave in ways that promote its success. In this paper we develop a new approach to fostering organizational identification based on principles of mental simulation. Across seven experiments we demonstrate that imagining positive contact with an organizational leader increases identification with the organization they represent. Experiments 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B replicated the basic effect against progressively varied control conditions, utilizing both scenario and field experiments. Experiment 4 demonstrated that as a consequence of heightened organizational identification following the imagined contact task, participants reported greater intentions to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. We conclude by discussing the potential application of this technique as a simple and effective way for organizations to foster employees' motivation and performance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Leadership; Mental simulation; Organizational identification; Social identity,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010521159&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2017.01.008&partnerID=40&md5=adc7bd895b7fb6313471b2c3f22fce95

The changing roles and expectations of the leaders are reflected in the employees' perceptions of them over time. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the 2011 Oslo bombing attack affected the targeted employees' perceptions of the leadership behaviors of their immediate superiors or the organizational managers' interest in the health and well-being of their workers. Ministerial employees (n ≈ 180) completed questionnaires on fair, empowering, and supportive leadership, in addition to human resource primacy, on two occasions several years prior to the terrorist attack. Assessments were then repeated one, two, and three years after the attack. Changes in the course of perceived leadership from predisaster to postdisaster were examined using bootstrapped t-tests and latent growth curve models. Furthermore, the general course of perceived leadership was compared with a nonexposed control sample of matched employees. Results showed that employees with high levels of posttraumatic stress perceived their immediate leader to be less supportive. However, overall perceptions of leadership were remarkably stable, which suggests that the effects of critical incidents on perceptions of leadership may be negligible. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Leadership; Terrorism; Trauma; Work environment; Workplace trauma,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009484154&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2017.01.002&partnerID=40&md5=f3f02b8b84658d9487dc59b62c0c77b4

We outline several key challenges which have shaped our followership psychology, and argue that the benefits of successful coordination in ancestral environments has led to the evolution of context-dependent psychological mechanisms which are especially attuned to cues and signals of outstanding personal leadership qualities.

Yet, what precisely constitutes charisma still remains somewhat enigmatic. So far, research has mainly focused on leader traits, leader behaviors, or the leader follower-relationship, and the subsequent consequences of each on followers' self-concepts. All of these approaches share the notion that leader charisma depends on an explicit interaction between leader and follower. With the present review paper, we extend extant theorizing by arguing that charisma is additionally informed by embodied signals that flow directly from either the leader or the immediate environment. We introduce the embodiment perspective on human perception and describe its utility for theoretically understanding the charismatic effect. Correspondingly, we review studies that show which concrete embodied cues can support the charismatic effect.

In this review, we adopt a recently developed definition of charismatic leadership and then conduct a meta-analysis of its antecedents and objective outcomes.

We propose that death is an event that will strengthen the connection between the leader and the group they belong to, which in turn will increase perceptions of leaders' charisma. In Study 1, results from an experimental study show that a scientist who is believed to be dead is regarded as more charismatic than the same scientist believed to be alive. Moreover, this effect was accounted for by people's perceptions that the dead scientist's fate is more strongly connected with the fate of the groups that they represent. In Study 2, a large-scale archival analysis of Heads of States who died in office in the 21st century shows that the proportion of published news items about Heads of State that include references to charisma increases significantly after their death.

Our work seeks to shift the scholarly dialogue by introducing the concept of character-competence entanglement, which reflects the binding between character and competence over time. The highest degree of entanglement represents the deep and more persistent interconnection and mutually-reinforcing effect between highly-developed leader character and highly-developed leader competence, whereas in cases of low entanglement, character can be activated temporarily in a particular context to help strengthen the relationship between competence and performance. Our core proposition is that high character-competence entanglement will lead to extraordinary performance over time.

Both implicit theories and time-based individual differences are commonly undiscussed, but their subtle effects can manifest explicitly in behaviors and consequences that have real implications for leaders and followers in organizations. Therefore, in this conceptual paper, we draw attention to time patience (the extent to which individuals are unconcerned with or unfocused on deadlines and the passage of time), time perspective (the relative importance of past, present, and future events in ongoing thought processes and decision-making), polychronicity (the preference for multitasking), and pacing style (the manner in which individuals distribute their effort over time in working toward deadlines) as neglected, but research-worthy components of followers' ILTs and leaders' IFTs.

Specifically, we discuss how leader-follower relational schema congruence/incongruence informs follower-rated LMX. Using polynomial regression models, we analyze 205 leader-follower dyads and test the congruent/incongruent effects on follower-rated LMX. The findings show that ERS congruence has a positive effect on follower-rated LMX, while IRS congruence has a negative effect on follower-rated LMX. Results also demonstrate that ERS incongruence impairs more follower-rated LMX than does ERS congruence, and IRS incongruence and IRS congruence have the same follower-rated LMX.

A test of the mediating effects of LMX on the relationship between ILT congruence and employees' development,Leadership Quarterly,2017,"Although there has been an increased interest in implicit leadership theories (ILTs) over the last two decades, only a handful of studies have examined the effects of ILT congruence among leader-follower dyads. Just as important, this research has largely suggested few effects for ILT congruence, focused exclusively on prototype congruence, examined a limited number of potential outcomes, and has failed to examine questions about ILT congruence utilizing the most appropriate statistical approaches. We examine the effects of ILT congruence, with an explicit focus on the possibility that congruence between supervisors and their employees on both prototypes and antiprototypes impacts the LMX developed within their dyads. We predict that LMX, in turn, affects employees' opportunities to engage in developmental activities. Using a sample of 74 matched pairs of supervisors and employees and polynomial regression and response surface methodology, we found that congruence between supervisors' and employees' prototypes positively influenced LMX. We also found limited evidence that LMX explained the effects of this congruence on employees' engagement in developmental activities. Although we found no evidence of antiprototype congruence effects, supervisors who rated antiprototypical traits as characteristic of leaders had lower LMX with their employees. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Employee developmental activities; ILT congruence; ILTs; LMX,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006100927&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2016.10.009&partnerID=40&md5=908916bf0e17f367e89da17e8a8de529

Being fast and universally understood, emotions are ideal stimuli for investigating the dynamic effects of ILTs, which were understood in this study in terms of the constraints that expressed emotions impose on the connectionist networks that activate ILTs. The experimental design contrasted videotaped and still frame presentations of a leadership event; however, this methodological factor had no significant effects and analyses were thus collapsed across this factor. Key findings were that the expression of a happy versus nervous emotion at the end of a problem-solving sequence had multiple effects: happy emotions resulted in higher leadership ratings, higher trait ratings, greater correlations among trait ratings, and greater dependence of trait ratings on leadership perceptions. An exploratory model suggested that leadership impressions mediated the effects of facial emotions on trait ratings. The discussion further links the study findings with interpretations in terms of ILTs and many types of constraints on these cognitive structures. It also suggests ways to integrate these ideas with advances in neuroscience research. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Endorsement of ILTs; Facial expressions; Implicit leadership theories; Leadership perceptions; Trait perceptions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006088647&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2016.10.013&partnerID=40&md5=6f56f21ed9e53374efaea54f8fd972ad

By incorporating social networks and social ledger theory with implicit leadership theories (ILTs), we hypothesize that formally assigned group leaders (managers) who have more positive advice ties and fewer negative avoidance ties are more likely to be recognized as leaders by their followers. Further, we posit that managers' informal networks bring them greater social power, an important attribute differentiating leaders from non-leaders. We conducted two survey-based studies in student and field teams to test the hypotheses. Based on nested data in both studies, we found support for our hypotheses. These results remain robust across the two studies even though they used different designs (cross-sectional versus longitudinal), different samples (field versus students) across different countries (United States versus India), and a host of control variables at both the leader and follower levels. We find that managers who are central in the advice network are socially powerful and are seen as leaders by individual followers. In contrast, managers who are avoided by followers lack informal social power are not seen as leaders. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings and the ways in which our theory and results extend ILTs and social network theory. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Implicit leadership theories; Social network; Social power; Team leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969959676&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2016.05.004&partnerID=40&md5=deb10722955b708b860fb9799edb6560

Once uncovered, these phenomena can have important implications for society. The utility of research depends on whether it makes a contribution because it is original or can add to cumulative research efforts, is rigorously and reliably done, and is able to inform basic or applied research and later policy. However, five serious “diseases” stifle the production of useful research. These diseases include: significosis, an inordinate focus on statistically significant results; neophilia, an excessive appreciation for novelty; theorrhea, a mania for new theory; arigorium, a deficiency of rigor in theoretical and empirical work; and finally, disjunctivitis, a proclivity to produce large quantities of redundant, trivial, and incoherent works. I surmise that these diseases have caused immense harm to science and have cast doubt on the role of science in society. I discuss what publication gatekeepers should do to eradicate these diseases, to stimulate the undertaking of more useful and impactful research, and to provide the needed incentives to better align the interests of researchers with those of the greater good.

In the present, we meta-analytically review the relationship between three leadership constructs (transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, and abusive supervision) and stress and burnout.

We investigate the effectiveness of 11 influence tactics from a comprehensive perspective using meta-analytic techniques. In particular, the current study focuses on relationships between each of the 11 influence tactics (i.e., rational persuasion, exchange, inspirational appeal, legitimating, apprising, pressure, collaboration, ingratiation, consultation, personal appeals, and coalition) and task- and relations-oriented outcomes. In addition, we investigate the moderating effects of the direction of influence tactics, measurement of influence tactics, singular influence tactic (versus use of a combination of influence tactics), independence of data sources, and study setting involved in the study. Regardless of task- and relations-oriented outcomes, based on 49 independent samples (N = 8987), our results show positive relationships between outcomes and rational persuasion, inspirational appeal, apprising, collaboration, ingratiation, consultation, and a negative relationship between pressure and outcomes. Rational persuasion is the only tactic which held stable positive relationships with both categories of outcomes regardless of moderating factors.

However, due to the substantial number of variables in this area and the different knowledge bases they are associated with (e.g., psychology, endocrinology, genetics), the literature is also becoming highly fragmented as it grows. This fragmentation is preventing different literature streams from effectively communicating with each other and synthesizing the rapidly expanding body of knowledge. Consequently, the continued growth of the individual differences literature is at risk. Therefore, we believe that classifying the relevant literature streams and reviewing the key variables in those streams will be beneficial. We do so by organizing this review and research agenda of the leadership literature on individual differences around the recent model developed by Antonakis, Day, and Schyns (2012). In doing so, we hope to unify some of the future research efforts around a recent and recognized conceptual model, and in turn facilitate communication between these different streams of literature. Moreover, insights from this literature also allow us to propose additions and refinements to the model of Antonakis, Day, and Schyns (2012) that may help scholars by indicating other fruitful areas for future research on individual differences. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Individual differences; Leadership behaviors; Multi-level outcomes,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006314764&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2016.10.011&partnerID=40&md5=e74cf7c9f238b1daf9ce19a974b48932

This allows us to map the evolution of the multi-level intellectual structure of the leadership field. Specifically, we identify a number of distinct colleges – their conceptualization of leadership and outcomes – and trace their evolution paths over thirty years.

However, little is known about the actual behaviors that cause those observations. Given that lay observers are prone to cognitive biases, such as the halo effect, the validity of theories that are exclusively based on observed behaviors is questionable. We thus follow the call of leading scientists in the field and derive a parsimonious model of leadership behavior that is informed by established psychological theories. Building on the taxonomy of Yukl (2012), we propose three task-oriented behavior categories (enhancing understanding, strengthening motivation and facilitating implementation) and three relation-oriented behavior categories (fostering coordination, promoting cooperation and activating resources), each of which is further specified by a number of distinct behaviors. While the task-oriented behaviors are directed towards the accomplishment of shared objectives, the relation-oriented behaviors support this process by increasing the coordinated engagement of the team members. Our model contributes to the advancement of leadership behavior theory by (1) consolidating current taxonomies, (2) sharpening behavioral concepts of leadership behavior, (3) specifying precise relationships between those categories and (4) spurring new hypotheses that can be derived from existing findings in the field of psychology.

Cushman's (2008) dual process model suggests that because followers simultaneously assess leaders' intentions and their causal nexus with negative outcomes, they might judge behavioral and moral integrity transgressions in different ways. Judgments of moral condemnation should primarily be a function of perceived intent while blame and punishment of the leader based on behavior should be jointly affected by cause and intent. This moral assessment is expected to influence followers' trust through its effect on moral identity.

Building on the literature on trust and social exchange theory, we hypothesize that individual-level leader charisma is indirectly related to team OCB through individual-level trust in leader. Additionally, we propose that the positive relationship between leader charisma and trust in leader is stronger under conditions of high organizational change. Based on data from 142 team members and 33 leaders, results reveal an indirect bottom-up relationship between individual-level leader charisma and team OCB through trust in leader. High change impact at the team- but not at the individual-level facilitates the positive relationship of leader charisma with trust in leader.

Drawing on the transactional model of stress and stress rigidity theory, we thus examine linkages between acute stressors and upper- and lower-level supportive leadership climates for teams of leaders. Employing survey data collected by the U.S. Army from military leaders and their subordinate soldiers in combat, we found support for a negative relationship between acute stressors and lower-level supportive leadership climate. Additionally, upper-level supportive leadership climate moderated the stressors-supportive leadership linkage, such that when upper-level supportive leadership climate was low, there was a more negative relationship between acute stressors and leaders providing supportive leadership to followers. In turn, this lower-level supportive leadership climate resulting from the acute stressors and upper-level supportive leadership climate interaction promoted followers' social cohesion. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",acute stressors; leadership teams; social cohesion; supportive leadership climate,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006248530&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2016.08.003&partnerID=40&md5=742f2a21c5eff2f3da6215f06acaff73

Previous work demonstrates that contexts of inter-group war and peace make followers prefer dominant- and non-dominant-looking leaders, respectively. We add an intra-group perspective to this literature. Four original studies demonstrate that contexts with high risks of free-riding and criminal behavior from other group members (i.e., horizontal exploitation) increase preferences for dominant-looking leaders, whereas contexts with high risks of unresponsive, self-interested behavior from leaders themselves (i.e., vertical exploitation) decrease preferences for dominant-looking leaders. Moreover, within this framework of intra-group exploitation risks we show that followers prefer leaders from another vis-ï¿½-vis their own ethnic coalition to look less dominant, and that this difference is driven by enhanced concerns for vertical exploitation from ethnically different leaders.

Further, drawing upon contingency theory, we test a contextual moderator, organizational structure, as a potential enhancer of the relationships between servant leadership and these outcomes. Using a sample of 1485 staff nurses and 105 nurse managers at nine hospitals, we demonstrated that servant leadership is directly related to more nurse helping and creative behavior, and it is related to patient satisfaction through nurse job satisfaction.

Yet little is known about the factors that determine whether followers perceive leaders as displaying authentic leadership. In the present research, we examine the impact of leaders' championing of collective (group) interests on authentic leadership. Study 1 shows experimentally that compared to a leader who advances personal interests, a leader who advances the interests of a collective is (a) perceived as offering more authentic leadership and (b) more likely to inspire followership. Findings are followed up in a field study revealing that leaders' championing of collective interests is associated with greater perceived authentic leadership and followership (in terms of voting intentions). Furthermore, results indicate that shared self-categorization is a boundary condition of these relationships such that the relationship between a leader's championing of collective (group) interests and authentic leadership (and followership) is more pronounced for perceivers who self-categorize as members of the group that a leader is leading (rather than of a different group).

Employees' perceived adaptivity alone did not increase job crafting in role overload situations, as predicted. Rather, the relationship between perceived role overload and job crafting was only positive when employees' perceived adaptivity was high and their leaders' need for structure was low.

To address this gap, we investigate whether leaders' well-being, in the form of positive affect and job stress, can be explained by LMX quality at the group level of analysis. We analyzed data from 1297 group members within 162 groups matched with individual leaders. Results showed that leaders' positive affect and job stress were uniquely explained by LMX differentiation (group-member data), even after several relevant variables, including fundamental leader attitudes and average LMX (group-member data), were taken into account. A subsequent analytical step revealed a significant interaction between average LMX and LMX differentiation for leader job stress, yet not for leader positive affect. Specifically, the positive relationship between LMX differentiation and leader job stress was discovered to be greater at low average LMX than at high average LMX.

1122,Elgar M.A.,Leader selection and leadership outcomes: Height and age in a sporting model,Leadership Quarterly,2016,"There is emerging interest in drawing insights from evolutionary biology to understand the nature of human leadership as a position within a social system. This perspective assumes that natural selection favors individuals who recognize leadership qualities that will benefit both leaders and followers. Physical stature, in particular, is frequently mentioned as a preferred human leadership trait. The present study documents and analyses the choice of leaders and its consequences for organization outcomes, using a model sporting system – the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. Team captains were no taller than their teammates, but they were consistently older, which had significant implications for team outcomes. The age of the captain was not correlated with team success, but it did influence team discipline: the frequency of serious infringements per game was negatively correlated with captain age. These results contradict the view that physical stature is a favored leadership trait, but nevertheless suggest that for human organizations, the search for leadership qualities might be profitably confined to those attributes that are likely to change with age and/or experience.

Three experimental studies with different samples aimed to examine how socio-structural variables that define intergroup relations impact on leader–follower relations and on the support that followers give to leaders who adopt different approaches to manage intergroup relations. We demonstrate that after manipulating the status and the stability of intergroup relations followers endorse leaders who strategically engage in group-oriented behaviour that maps onto optimal identity-management strategies. These patterns mirrored differences across contexts in the perceived prototypicality. We conclude that intergroup relations influence leaders' strategic behaviour and followers' reaction to them.

In this study, we investigate the effect of temporal leadership and shared temporal cognitions on team performance via temporal conflict and test whether the impact of temporal leadership on temporal conflict may be substituted by shared temporal cognitions. Our study was conducted in a management simulation involving 142 teams working on a task over 5 weeks. Results suggest that temporal conflict mediates the relationship between temporal leadership and team performance as well as between shared temporal cognitions and team performance. Further, we found support for the idea that shared temporal cognitions function as a substitute of temporal leadership for reducing temporal conflict in teams. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Shared temporal cognitions; Substitute for leadership; Team performance; Temporal conflict; Temporal leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953426000&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.12.002&partnerID=40&md5=05f3cebb3a40abc48e10a3b3224456cc

These incidents of creative deviance are usually examined in terms of the personal characteristics of employees and the structural properties of the work context. We introduce a third theoretical angle that focuses on the role leaders play in creative deviance. Drawing on the extant creativity, deviance, and leadership literatures, we argue that five leader responses to employee creative deviance – forgiving, rewarding, punishing, ignoring, and manipulating – exert differential influences on its consequences. Findings from a study of 226 leader–employee dyads at two advertising firms in China show that creative deviance and supportive supervision for creativity interact to influence the forgiving, rewarding, punishing, and ignoring responses. In turn, forgiving and punishing influence subsequent creative deviance, while rewarding, punishing, and manipulating influence subsequent creative performance. The study reveals that leaders' responses to creative deviance convey the joint effect of initial creative deviance and supportive supervision for creativity to subsequent creative deviance and creative performance.

We predicted that work-life practices would increase the proportion of women in management, but their impact would be most evident when the workforce gender composition makes gender stereotypes less salient. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the relationship between work-life practices in 2002-2006 and the proportion of women in management in 2010, 2012, and 2014. Overall, work-life practices had a positive effect on the proportion of women in management, but only after an eight-year lag. However, this positive effect was not observed in organizations that were highly male-dominated. Leave arrangements and direct provision of services (e.g., childcare or eldercare) had the strongest associations with women in management.

How gender stereotypes of emotion lead to biased evaluations of female leaders,Leadership Quarterly,2016,"The belief that women are more emotional than men is one of the strongest gender stereotypes held in Western cultures (Shields, 2002). And yet, gender stereotypes of emotion have received little attention from gender and leadership scholars. In this paper, I review the existing research on gender and emotions and propose that gender stereotypes of emotion present a fundamental barrier to women's ability to ascend to and succeed in leadership roles. I first define the nature of people's gender-emotion stereotypes and outline why perceptions of emotionality may be particularly detrimental to women when they are in high-status positions in work contexts. I then suggest that gender-emotion stereotypes create two complex minefields that female, but not male, leaders have to navigate in order to be successful: (1) identifying how much emotion should be displayed and (2) identifying what kind of emotions should be displayed. Specifically, female leaders can be penalized for even minor or moderate displays of emotion, especially when the emotion conveys dominance (e.g., anger or pride), but being emotionally unexpressive may also result in penalties because unemotional women are seen as failing to fulfill their warm, communal role as women. I conclude by considering the interactive role of race and ethnicity with regards to gender stereotypes of emotion and proposing avenues for future research. © 2016.",Emotion; Gender; Gender stereotypes; Leadership; Prejudice,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964597325&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2016.02.005&partnerID=40&md5=2d1ff1e5d301bbe5358adf1efe7180f6

We propose that the degree to which agentic deficiencies and penalties occur is contingent on the dimension of agency that is under consideration and its relation to the stereotypes associated with the target's gendered and racial group. The results of our literature review and analysis suggest that when considered in the context of gender and leadership research, at least two dimensions of agency, competence and dominance, closely align with perceptions of agentic deficiency and agentic penalty, respectively. Based on our analysis and the prevalent stereotypes of Black and Asian American women that are likely most relevant to the two types of biases against women leaders, we examined the interactive effects of racial stereotypes and the agentic biases. We suggest that when specific racial and gendered stereotypes are aligned with a specific dimension of agency, we can gain a more thorough understanding of how agentic biases may hinder women's progression to leadership positions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Agency; Gender; Intersectionality; Leadership; Race,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961223743&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2016.01.008&partnerID=40&md5=d0f27bcad000cbc4e9d34d6cecae48c1

We take a multi-level perspective to understand and unpack the complex interplay between individual gender, group gender composition, and group personality composition. Drawing from perspectives such as social role theory and the social identity model of leadership, we theorize as to when women are most likely to emerge as leaders, even in groups composed predominantly of men. Results from two studies indicated that individual level gender does not interact with group gender composition to predict leadership emergence, suggesting that groups with more men do not disproportionally choose men as leaders, and groups with more women similarly do not tend to have women emerge as leaders. However, a three-way interaction consistently appeared in our studies when group-level extraversion was added to individual and group gender, in a pattern suggesting that group extraversion alters leader emergence patterns in groups with more men. Our findings demonstrate that women become more likely to emerge as leaders when their groups are both high in extraversion, and composed of more men than women.

We propose that rather than being a source of gender inequality, the queen bee phenomenon is itself a consequence of the gender discrimination that women experience at work. We substantiate this argument with research showing that (1) queen bee behavior is a response to the discrimination and social identity threat that women may experience in male-dominated organizations, and (2) queen bee behavior is not a typically feminine response but part of a general self-group distancing response that is also found in other marginalized groups.

When women hold powerful positions, they have a harder time than men eliciting respect and admiration (i.e., status) from subordinates.

Unless they are able to legitimize their role, relative illegitimacy will prompt a variety of consequences such as more negative subordinate behavior and reduced cooperation when the leader is a woman. Subordinate rejection will likely put female leaders in a precarious mindset, and trigger negative responses toward subordinates; such behavior can confirm negative expectations of female leaders and further undermine female authority in a self-reinforcing cycle of illegitimacy.

Building from a sensemaking framework, we propose that a supervisor's perceptions of the collective navigator role (the establishing and enacting of strategic vision among members of a team) in their immediate supervisor-level work group ultimately links to the collective leadership navigator role in the lower-level team he or she leads thereby illustrating the vertical flow of collective leadership across organizational levels. To understand how this cascading process operates, we propose that two key characteristics of supervisors, their job satisfaction and empowering leadership behaviors, mediate the linkage between collective strategic visions at these different levels.

Despite a growing stream of academic studies exploring positive outcomes of servant leadership practice, little is known empirically about the underlying psychological processes that are activated to enhance individual performance at work. Using the autonomous motivational framework of Self-Determination Theory's (SDT) basic psychological needs (Ryan and Deci, 2000), we propose that a servant leader's attentive focus on employees' development helps fulfillemployees' three basic psychological needs, namely for autonomy, competence and relatedness. In turn, satisfaction of each of these three needs fuels employees in a distinctway, either producing an increase in task performance, organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) or both.We collected information from247 supervisor-employee dyads from a large Canadian technology design and manufacturing company. Structural equation modeling results indicate that servant leadership strongly predicted all three needs' satisfaction; autonomy need satisfaction mediated servant leadership's effect on task performance, OCBIndividual (OCB-I) and OCB-Organization (OCB-O); competence need satisfaction mediated servant leadership's effect on task performance only; and relatedness need satisfaction mediated servant leadership's effect on both OCB-I and OCB-O. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Basic psychological needs; OCB; Self-determination theory; Servant leadership; Task performance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953351998&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.08.004&partnerID=40&md5=31bbe76f0ff9ae09477a67b2d2a2898b

In this review, we show how research examining a number of aspects of attitudes (content, structure and function) can advance understanding of leadership perceptions and how these affect work-related outcomes. Such a perspective provides a more multi-faceted understanding of leadership perceptions than previously envisaged and this can provide a more detailed understanding of how such perceptions affect outcomes.

Although the impact of facial cues to trustworthiness and dominance on a number of social outcomes has been established outside of the workplace, the extent to which they, in addition to attractiveness, affect pay at different managerial levels is yet to be investigated. This paper presents research into this issue using a face payment task for shop floor managers (Retail Managers) and senior managers (Heads of Retail Operations). Evaluations indicated that all three facial cues were positively associated with awarded pay at both managerial levels. Moreover, attractiveness had a significantly stronger link with shop-floor managers' than senior managers' pay, whereas perceived trustworthiness and perceived dominance had significantly stronger links with pay for senior managers than shop-floor managers. It further emerged that women were paid more in this experimental task where pay was awarded solely based on facial features and that the facial features were more predictive of women's than men's pay.

Data from a multisource survey of 129 Chinese firms demonstrate the importance of the fit between the backgrounds of the leader and the TMT members. Although empowerment of TMTs by CEOs predicts superior organizational performance in general, the findings show that this practice is most beneficial when the CEO and the TMT members differ in their informational demographics but have a longer tenure overlap. If either dissimilarity in informational demographics or tenure overlap is lacking, the CEO's empowerment of the TMT has a less positive effect on firm performance.

Two experiments (Studies 2 and 3) show that increased market competition makes leaders' disciplining of ethical transgressions more contingent upon the transgression's instrumentality to the organization: the same ethical transgression is punished less when it resulted in profit than when it resulted in loss. This research is among the first to identify conditions that determine disciplinary responses of organization leaders to ethical transgressions, and it feeds the debate on whether market competition promotes the display of unethical behavior within organizations. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Disciplining behavior; Ethical decision-making; Market competition; Punishment; Unethical behavior,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939857221&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.07.004&partnerID=40&md5=4509979a512a0806ed35f6233ca40602

The mechanisms underlying this link, however, are not well understood. To identify the intervening processes inherent in this relationship, we experimentally manipulated the leadership style assigned to 44 teams taking part in a resource-maximization task. Teams were exposed either to a leader using inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, or a control condition. Our findings reveal important differences between leadership styles in communication and team outcomes (objective task performance and creativity). These results suggest that different dimensions of transformational leadership should be emphasized depending on the outcome sought. In addition, our results provide evidence for a sequential mediation model where leadership influences team outcomes through overall team communication and trust in teammates. This study suggests mechanisms by which transformational leaders may impact team outcomes, which has implications for team building and leadership training. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Communication; Creativity; Team performance; Team trust; Transformational leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939825129&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.07.007&partnerID=40&md5=006167639d1969c070a4301e7159d166

While some countries have achieved higher proportions of female directors on their corporate boards, others have not registered even a single one.

The study shows that key social institutions have the potential to alleviate such stereotypical attitudes or to maintain the status quo. Employing a robust statistical technique in two-stage least squares (2SLS), this study finds that the representation of women in other key national institutions, such as in politics, positively affects the appointment of female directors on boards.

However, the social dynamics underlying the benefits of transformational leadership remain elusive to date. To understand how and why transformational leadership can foster team functioning, this study focuses on leader-follower communication dynamics during team interactions. From the perspective of leadership as social problem solving, we argue that transformational leadership is linked to functional team problem-solving processes because transformational leaders use solution-focused communication (mediator model). In a sample of 30 videotaped problem-solving team meetings from two organizations, we coded transformational leadership style and the verbal behavioral interactions of leaders and team members over the course of their entire meetings (30,128 behavioral units in total). Multilevel results showed that transformational leadership was positively linked to functional problem-solving communication by team members. This positive relationship was mediated by leaders' solution-focused communication. Moreover, at the micro-level of conversational dynamics within the meeting process, lag sequential analysis revealed that leaders' ideas and solutions triggered subsequent solution statements by team members and inhibited counterproductive communication by team members, such as running off topic, criticizing, or complaining. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications for conceptualizing dynamic leader-follower processes as well as managerial implications for leading effective meetings in organizations. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Lag sequential analysis; Leader-follower communication; Meetings; Team interaction processes; Transformational leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938261693&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=a1a010e73ffc19b3e41dd0d0aa2ec244

Results based on leaders and followers in three organizations show that leader surface acting acted as a boundary condition, neutralizing the effects of the frequencies of positive and negative leader emotional displays toward an individual follower on that follower's performance. In addition, higher frequency of negative emotional displays shown by the leader to all group members acted as a boundary condition, neutralizing the effect of the frequency of negative leader emotional displays toward an individual follower on that follower's performance.

In contrast to previous evidence that anger displays can increase follower motivation and in-role performance, Study 1 (a scenario study among employees of various companies) revealed a decrease in willingness to perform OCB after a leader expressed anger rather than happiness. In Study 2 (a lab experiment involving university students), participants expended less effort working overtime after being confronted with an angry rather than a happy leader.

In this paper, I review emotional contagion research as it relates to multiple levels of analysis within an organization and discuss the extent to which this process can be managed by leaders. The review begins with an explanation of the processes underpinning the emotional contagion process, highlighting the neurological mechanisms that give rise to implicit and explicit forms of emotional contagion. In the following section, I discuss some individual differences that moderate the experience of these two forms of emotional contagion. Subsequently, I review how emotional contagion processes impact leadership outcomes at the interpersonal, group and finally, organizational levels. The purpose of the current review is threefold. The first is to refine understandings of the emotional dynamics of leadership influence from a neurological perspective, highlighting how implicit and explicit emotional contagion underpins much of leader-follower interactions. Second, the review extends on conceptualizations of emotional contagion in leadership interactions often captured at the interpersonal level, and illustrates how the process is relevant in influencing group level organizational leadership outcomes. Third, the review also highlights themes emerging from this area of research, and concludes with directions for further research.

Results show that leader positive affect is positively related to leadership criteria, whereas leader negative affect is negatively related to leadership criteria, and regression analyses indicate that leader trait affect predicts leadership criteria above and beyond leader extraversion and neuroticism.

In our main study, using data from a sample of 180 executives, we apply structural equation models to test our predictions. We find that self-comparisons with concrete, influential leaders of the past or present (self-to-exemplar comparisons) relate positively to MTL. We also find that self-comparisons with more general representations of leaders (self-to-prototype comparisons in affiliation) relate to MTL.

However, theories on social hierarchy suggest that autocratic leadership may also positively affect morale and performance through the creation of a psychologically appealing, hierarchically-ordered environment of predictability and security. We propose that autocratic leadership can foster team psychological safety when team members accept the hierarchy within the team. In contrast, when members challenge the hierarchy and engage in intrateam power struggles, autocratic leaders' centralizing power behaviors will clash with team members' competition for power and frustrate members, impairing psychological safety and performance. We find support for these ideas in a study of 60 retail outlets (225 employees and their managers) in the financial services industry. As expected, when team power struggles were low, autocratic leadership was positively related to team psychological safety, and thereby indirectly positively related to team performance.

The authors proposed a psychological process in which ethical leadership affects emotional exhaustion directly and indirectly through team cohesion. As military operational contexts typically are (or frequently have the potential to become) high moral intensity situations, the authors tested their model among 338 military personnel deployed in combat zones. They found that: (1) team cohesion partially mediated the relationship between ethical leadership and emotional exhaustion, and (2) this psychological process of direct and indirect effects of ethical leadership did not hold among individuals approaching the low end of conscientiousness. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Cohesion; Conscientiousness; Emotional exhaustion; Ethical leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943454088&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.01.006&partnerID=40&md5=c9d42ab761ab9ac9638744b0b0b96dcc

Twin studies have further revealed significant genetic effects on leadership role occupancy. In the era of genomics, the current research examines how a dopamine transporter gene, DAT1, is involved in genetic influences on leadership role occupancy. Study 1 found DAT1 10-repeat allele to negatively relate to proactive personality, which in turn was positively associated with leadership role occupancy. The negative indirect effect was significant, but the overall relationship between this gene and leadership was not. In addition to replicating Study 1's findings using a nationally representative sample, Study 2 revealed another countervailing mechanism: DAT1 was positively related to (moderate) rule breaking, which was positively associated with leadership role occupancy.

However, leaders sometimes yet fail to do so. Previous research has indicated that leaders may refrain from enacting discipline out of self-interest or from concern for the organization's interest. We explore another option: leaders may simply be unwilling to enforce moral norms because of a negative attitude towards them. We argue and show that leaders that construe norms on relatively low (i.e. concrete) levels are likely to see norms as annoying obstacles, whereas leaders that construe moral norms on high (i.e. abstract) levels will have a more positive view of norms. In line with this, high construal level leaders are likely to be willing to enforce moral norms through discipline in response to follower moral transgressions. Low construal level leaders, in contrast, actively avoid doing so.

Using a Romanian sample of 302 followers under the supervision of 27 leaders, we found that ethical leadership has an indirect effect on follower job performance and voice (through the mediating mechanisms of both organizational and relational identifications) and that these relationships are stronger for followers who held the implicit theory that a person's moral character is fixed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Ethical leadership; Implicit theory of morality; Organizational identification; Relational identification; Voice,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943451761&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.01.004&partnerID=40&md5=f2d1c763e23084d6bbaeee4540807da0

An examination of neurotic and introverted followers and their organizational citizenship behavior,Leadership Quarterly,2015,"Despite the massive amount of transformational leadership research, the role of followers has not been well-examined in the transformational leadership literature. To understand how leader-follower interactions influence follower organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), we examined the cross-level interactions between transformational leadership and two follower personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion). Using a sample of 215 leaders and 1284 followers, results showed that follower neuroticism moderated the relationships between transformational leadership and organizational citizenship behavior directed toward other individuals (OCB-I) and toward the organization (OCB-O), such that relationships were stronger for those high in neuroticism. Further, follower extraversion moderated the relationships between transformational leadership and OCB-I and OCB-O, such that relationships were stronger for those low in extraversion. Therefore, the inspirational and developmental nature of transformational leaders can offset follower neuroticism and introversion and guide these employees to perform more OCB despite their tendencies to worry, lack confidence, and be shy and withdrawn. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Extraversion; Neuroticism; Organizational citizenship behavior; Substitutes for leadership; Transformational leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943450154&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2015.06.005&partnerID=40&md5=0b72fe0337fcbda5eea1a78cc9dedb40

However, we argue that such encouragement is more effective when leaders are seen as less transformational, because followers are then less able to benefit from their leaders' social capital. We support our arguments with a study of 142 followers and their leaders. Our findings show that followers engage in greater networking behaviors when encouraged by their leaders to do so, but this association is moderated by leaders' transformational leadership style such that it is stronger as transformational leadership behaviors decrease.

Based on new theorizing and a series of three studies involving experiments and field work, we show that the two types of leadership have different effects on followers' emotional expressiveness. Specifically, we find that followers under the influence of leaders' charisma tend to suppress the expression of emotions (we call this the ""awestruck effect""), but followers express emotions when leaders consider them individually.

Much less is known about the role that empathic concern, an affect-laden construct, plays in predicting a leader's career advancement using measures of one's upward mobility, such as career derailment potential. Data provided by practicing managers in Australia show that leaders who displayed behaviors that convey empathic concern receive lower ratings of career derailment potential. We also found that gender was a statistically significant moderator of these relationships. With boss rating of derailment potential as the outcome, the negative relationship between empathic concern and derailment potential was statistically significant for women only. With peer ratings of derailment potential as the outcome, the negative relationship between empathic concern and derailment potential was stronger for women than men.

One goal of this issue was to expand the focus of research beyond moods and generalized affect to discrete emotions andmechanisms through which emotions exert influence such as emotional contagion, empathy, and emotional authenticity. Relative to positive and negative affectivity, discrete emotions,mediators, and moderators of leader emotions have been studied far less. A second goalwas to highlight the importance and role of emotion regulation strategies, mechanisms, and effects in the dynamic exchanges between leaders and followers.

Furthermore, these effects were either amplified or attenuated under different conditions (i.e., leader identification and power distance orientation). A cross-level investigation of voice behavior within 52 groups of employees from multiple Chinese companies in Beijing was conducted. The results showed that supervisor authoritarian leadership negatively affected employee voice behavior and mediated the negative relationship between manager authoritarian leadership and employee voice behavior.

Specifically, we study the degree to which a leader identifies with an organization and how this possibly unlocks the effects of transformational or transactional leadership. Using multilevel data collected in a large multinational company, our findings reveal that both transformational and transactional leadership is effective in motivating followers to commit to the goals of an ideation program. Increased commitment, in turn, is associated with more ideas that followers generate.

Our results, based on a specially-designed management simulation game conducted with experienced Chinese managers, show that high publicity of decline elevates leaders' image concerns, which in turn increases their impression management during decline.

Second, both CEO charisma and transformational leadership climate are proposed to increase a firm's organizational identity strength (OIDS), which in turn, relates positively to firm performance. We tested these propositions on a sample of 150 German companies (20,639 employees) with a three-path mediation model at the organizational level of analysis, utilizing four independent data sources.

However, there are many contexts, particularly in transitional economies lacking strong bureaucratic work structures (e.g., China, Brazil), where personal exchanges outside of the work domain serve as a critical, binding fabric in the workplace. One such example is the indigenous Chinese concept of guanxi, which captures the personal ties between supervisors and subordinates and operates as a protective mechanism for subordinates and a loyalty-inducing agent for supervisors. Using 281 supervisor-subordinate dyads from China, we explored an important antecedent and consequences of guanxi while controlling for the parallel process of the traditionally work-focused construct leader-member exchange (LMX).

To capture both the evolution and expression of leader traits, we propose a dynamic model. We argue that the evolution of traits consists of changes in intensity and nature. Based on data on five publicly acknowledged Chinese leaders collected from various sources, we identified three patterns (homological, converse, and composite) by which leader traits evolve. We also discovered that leader's traits can be intrinsic or extrinsic. The intrinsic traits change in intensity; whereas the extrinsic traits are replaced by other traits over time. Factors influencing these changes include both internal (e.g., leaders' own learning and introspection) and external (e.g., major social events and subtle cultural influences).

Data from 223 followers and their leaders situated across 60 workgroups demonstrate that the effects of individual perceived LMX quality are contingent upon a group's overall variability in LMX (i.e., LMX differentiation) and employees' similarity in terms of LMX with their coworkers (i.e., LMX relational separation). Specifically, the effects of high quality LMX relationships on OCB and turnover intentions are weaker when group LMX differentiation or employees' LMX relational separation is higher, rather than lower.

Ownership, governance and the influence of CEOs on firm performance",Leadership Quarterly,2014,"Leadership and strategic management research suggests that the extent to which CEOs influence performance largely depends on the presence or absence of certain factors. These factors may include the characteristics of the task at hand, subordinates, the organization itself or the external environment. Among these factors, a fundamental contingency that has received little empirical attention is an organization's ownership and governance structure-that is, who owns and monitors the organization. In this paper, we outline how different ownership and governance structures can present the opportunity for, or limit, leader influence and empirically examine the extent to which CEO effects on financial performance depend on these structures. Examining organizations in the same industry but with different ownership and governance structures, our results suggest that these structures are closely aligned with the degree to which CEOs influence firm performance. Our findings support the notion that leaders matter most when ownership and governance structures correspond with a weak or ambiguous institutional logic. This study contributes new insight into the ""opportunity structure"" of CEO influence, that is, the organizational factors that shape leader discretion and, hence, condition the CEO's level of influence over firm performance. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",CEO discretion; Firm performance; Institutional logics; Opportunity structure; Ownership and governance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897661178&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2013.09.004&partnerID=40&md5=901c8c7548dc1d941f989718a9be9f89

Using employee ratings of personality for the CEOs of 32 prominent high-technology firms, we investigate whether more narcissistic CEOs have compensation packages that are systematically different from their less narcissistic peers, and specifically whether these differences increase the longer the CEO stays with the firm. As predicted, we find that more narcissistic CEOs who have been with their firm longer receive more total direct compensation (salary, bonus, and stock options), have more money in their total shareholdings, and have larger discrepancies between their own (higher) compensation and the other members of their team. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",CEO; Executive compensation; Leadership; Narcissism,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897658974&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2013.08.002&partnerID=40&md5=5e8b62f727063fe2fcf8ab4e5bca2239

Study 1 demonstrates experimentally that compared to low-identified followers, highly identified followers perceive themselves to share relational identity with a leader when that leader is representative of their ingroup (but not if that leader is representative of an outgroup). Followers' relational identification, in turn, influences not only their experience of a personal bond with the leader but also perceptions of leader charisma. Study 2 replicates these findings in the context of Presidential candidates in the 2012 US election and extends them by examining leader prototypicality as a further moderating factor.

Research has found spirituality to be most beneficial when fostered at the individual rather than collective level (Herman & Gioia, 1998; Krishnakumar & Neck, 2002). Yet, little is known about how leaders deploy workplace spirituality to the individual level and sustain it over time. To address this question, the case is made that spirituality at work may best be fostered through a dyadic mentorship. Accordingly, a concept of spiritual mentoring is proposed, which takes an authentic self perspective to spirituality while approaching spiritual development as best served through a co-created, dyadic process. Drawing on previous research, spiritual mentoring is organized into three categories - inner life, meaningful work, and context/connectedness - and presented as a temporal process through which leaders may provide these supportive behaviors.

Much of this discussion fell under the broad label of ""virtual"" with authors at that time speculating how such technology might impact how leadership was practiced and investigated.

We examine intrapersonal and interpersonal issues related to the phenomena that develop during the pursuit of effective leadership, describe how development emerges with an emphasis on multi-source or 360-degree feedback processes, review longitudinal studies of leadership development, and investigate methodological and analytical issues in leader and leadership development research. Future research directions to motivate and guide the study of leader and leadership development are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",360-degree feedback; Leader development; Leadership development; Longitudinal research; Self-other agreement,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892507982&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2013.11.004&partnerID=40&md5=4e43f17226b4dd4ff5c69bc41845c685

One influential factor that has only been scarcely explored, however, is the context in which leadership occurs. The present studies examined the effect of two such contextual variables: economic conditions across time and economic conditions across nations. In Study 1, inferences of leadership ability from the faces of American Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) predicted their companies' financial performance prior to the Financial Crisis of 2008 but not after. In Study 2, traits previously found to predict the success of American CEOs before the Financial Crisis (i.e., Power) predicted the success of CEOs in Germany in the year following the crisis but not in the US, consistent with the differential impact of the international recession in the two nations. These results suggest that economic events may affect the relationship between facial appearance and business leaders' success. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",CEO; Culture; Facial appearance; Leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924084111&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2014.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=fd954d6678e52374c55ab37e878d0c5e

However, much less is known about the accuracy or meta-accuracy of face-based leadership inferences. Here we examine a simple, but important, question: Can leadership domain be inferred from faces? We find that human judges can identify business, military, and sports leaders (but not political leaders) from their faces with above-chance accuracy. However, people are surprisingly bad at evaluating their own performance on this judgment task: We find no relationship between how well judges think they performed and their actual accuracy levels. In a follow-up study, we identify several basic dimensions of evaluation that correlate with face-based judgments of leadership domain, as well as those that predict actual leadership domain.

We found that perceivers could accurately discern conductors' success from brief video clips and that perceptions of expressiveness and age formed the basis for this accuracy.

Direction of employee-supervisor disagreement is also important as employee overestimation of supervisor commitment is associated with more favorable outcomes than employee underestimation.

Limitations associated with common method bias and modest effect sizes notwithstanding, our findings inform theory on specifically why it is that extraverts are perceived as better leaders than introverts.

In the current research, we identify a measureable physical trait - the facial width-to-height ratio - that predicts negotiation performance in men. Across four studies, we show that men with greater facial width-to-height ratios are less cooperative negotiators compared to men with smaller facial ratios. This lack of cooperation allows men with greater facial width-to-height ratios to claim more value when negotiating with other men, but inhibits their ability to discover creative agreements that benefit all negotiating parties.

We first distinguish between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and we then draw on upper echelons theory and executive personality research to hypothesize and test a model in which CEO grandiose narcissism is positively related to TMT behavioral integration when CEOs are high in organizational identification. The relationship is expected to be negative when CEOs do not identify strongly with their organizations. TMT behavioral integration, in turn, predicts subsequent firm performance. Findings based on multi-source data from a sample of 97 CEOs and their firms supported the hypotheses. These results highlight the complex nature of CEO grandiose narcissism - namely, that the construct has both positive and negative aspects as it relates to top management team dynamics and firm performance and that the relationship is affected by CEOs' identification with their organizations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",CEO narcissism; CEO personality; Firm performance; Organizational identification; TMT behavioral integration,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919630340&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2014.06.004&partnerID=40&md5=97315dc37c7b2d40bdb139003dce577d

A theoretical connection is made between the exploration-exploitation dilemma and age-biased leadership preferences for exploratory change versus stable exploitation. For the majority of human evolution our species was semi- or entirely nomadic and the trade-off between exploration versus exploitation had substantial physical- and experience-based requirements which align with leadership opportunities as moderated by age. Thus, given the consistency and importance of correctly assigning leadership for the exploration-exploitation dilemma, human evolution has likely selected for age-biased leadership endorsement. Across three experiments we find that younger-looking leaders are endorsed for times of exploratory change and older-looking leaders for stable exploitation. Further, our results indicated that older leaders are endorsed for leading conservative exploitation of nonrenewable resources and younger leaders for exploration of renewable alternatives (i.e., green leadership).

Drawing on an empirical study of an inter-professional, inter-organizational network (number of nodes. = 23) that delivers health and social care, we address two research gaps: (i) the effect of power relations, derived from professional hierarchy, upon spread of plural leadership; and (ii) the effect of formal leadership, derived from managerial accountability, in channeling the spread of plural leadership for coherent strategic effect. We show that, in a routine situation, the network is characterized by generalized leadership exchanges. In this situation, professional hierarchy and managerial accountability are not visible, nor is channeling of plural leadership by the formal leader. In a non-routine situation, when a disruptive event occurs, the network is characterized by restricted exchange.

Using one multi-source field study and three experiments, we showed that employees' OCB towards coworkers (OCBI) negatively impacted self-serving leadership. Moreover, we also examine the underlying mechanism for this relation. Results indicate that employees' OCBI mitigated leaders' hindrance stress, which mediates the relationship between OCBI and self-serving leadership.

An experimental design tested the effectiveness of three social identity framing communication tactics (inclusive language, similarity language, positive social identity language) on follower outcomes. Students (N= 246) completed dependent measures after reading one of eight possible leader speeches promoting renewable energy on campus. Results showed that participants exposed to inclusive language were more likely to: indicate that renewable energy was ingroup normative; intend to engage in collective action to bring renewable energy to campus; experience positive emotions and confidence about change; and to view the leader more positively. The combination of inclusive language and positive social identity increased ratings of leader charisma. Perceived leader prototypicality was related to followers' social identification, environmental values, ingroup injunctive norms, and self-stereotypes. Positive social identity language increased collective self-esteem. These results underline the important role of implicating social identity in leader communication that strives to mobilize follower support for social change. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Communication; Environmental sustainability; Leadership; Social change; Social identity framing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901004298&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2013.10.013&partnerID=40&md5=5d58c216aede58c448f3d4cc22ee873c

This conceptualization of leaders' trust of members describes how leaders emplot members in storylines characterized as predictably good, unpredictable, or predictably bad, and catalogs the formal communication practices indicative of those predictions. Forty working adults, who have reputations for being effective leaders, were interviewed. Constant comparative analysis revealed leaders attempted to produce stories with characterological coherence about members' character development throughout role negotiations. The Leader-to-Member Narrative Sensemaking of Trust (LMNST) concept describes how participants reported trusting and doubting (often simultaneously) their members by evoking combinations of seven narrative elements (i.e., selection, probation, escalation, confederation, jeopardy, redemption, and termination).

This paper examines leader-member relationship differentiation from an indigenous, leader-member guanxi (LMG) perspective.

The results of this study supported the proposed dual effects of LMG differentiation, demonstrating that LMG differentiation, in general, is detrimental to employees' work attitudes and their intentions to stay in an organization.

Attachment theory states that individuals have internal working models that are influenced by both early developmental experiences and relationships later in life. These models guide how people interact with close others and tend toward three styles of attachment: secure, insecure-ambivalent, and insecure-avoidant. We argue that securely attached persons are most likely to exhibit authentic leadership/followership. We review empirical work which suggests that secure attachment is positively related to each of the four components of authentic leadership/followership (self-awareness, relational transparency, balanced processing, and internalized moral perspective). We then develop an attachment-based typology for variations in authentic leader-follower relationships, with emphasis on relationships that include an insecurely attached party.

We examine in particular research from four key areas: social identity perspectives on leadership, intergroup emotion theory, collective action, and reciprocal affect within leader-follower interactions. Our central proposition is that followers engage in actions, driven by both cognitive and affective-based processes, which affect leadership outcomes. Moreover, because leaders are part of the groups they lead and therefore embedded within the social context of a group, we propose that any action that affirms or threatens the salient group will trigger both cognitive and emotional responses from followers towards leaders. These include the extent to which a leader engages in actions that are perceived as (1) self-sacrificial, (2) procedurally fair, and (3) expressing emotions congruent with that of their group. We also propose that the extent to which followers translate their perceptions and emotions towards collective action towards their leaders will be moderated by individual-level group identification and group-level shared identity.

We argue that LMX theory remains incomplete until contextual factors surrounding these pivotal relationships are accounted for including the impact of coworker exchange relationships, peer exchange, and perceptions of justice regarding individual LMX relationships. A fully crossed experimental design manipulating participant LMX and distributive justice and coworker LMX and distributive justice was employed to understand how these constructs affect coworker exchange relationships. Support was found for a causal model which specifies that justice moderates the causal relationship between LMX similarity and CWX, which subsequently leads to increased sharing of resources among coworkers. The data suggest that workgroup members are savvy to differences within individual leader-member relationships, where the sharing of resources among peers is determined by their own LMX, the LMX of their coworker and perceptions of justice of their respective LMX levels.

Next, we explain how these underlying ideas lead us to a fundamental theory about close relationships-that is, self-expansion theory, which refers to a psychological process in which an individual incorporates another into the self (Aron & Aron, 1986). We then review the traditional leadership theories to explore whether these theories may be linked through self-expansion theory and whether self-expansion may help to explain why boundary conditions have been discovered for all of them.

Moreover, an empirical scoring key was developed that weights each item response according to its relation with leadership effectiveness in each situation. In Study 3, we demonstrated incremental validity and interrater agreement. The test fills an important gap in literature because it not only has predictive validity above and beyond established measures, but also takes into account the contextual element of leadership. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Full Range of Leadership Model; Leadership assessment; Situational judgment test,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883765328&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2013.07.006&partnerID=40&md5=64b16088be238ab168e5616a305ec373

Using survey responses of 203 subordinate-supervisor dyads in South Korea, hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between a supervisor's abusive behaviors and an employee's creative performance. Specifically, employees exhibited more creativity when abusive supervision was at a moderate level rather than at very low or very high levels.

A multi-foci social exchange perspective,Leadership Quarterly,2013,"Drawing on social exchange theory, the present study investigates the underlying mechanisms through which transformational leadership influences employee turnover. Leader-member exchange (LMX) and affective commitment (AC) are proposed as supervisor-based and organization-based social exchange mechanisms respectively, exemplifying how social exchange processes occur between an employee and his/her supervisor, and between the employee and his/her organization as a whole to underpin the effect of transformational leadership on turnover outcomes. Results of structural equation modeling on a sample of 490 full-time employees working in a large telecommunication company in the PRC provided support for the notion that transformational leadership is related to both social exchange mechanisms - LMX and AC - turnover intention and turnover behavior. Furthermore, the results revealed that AC rather than LMX mediated the link between transformational leadership and turnover intention. Turnover intention also only mediated the relationship between AC and turnover behavior over time. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Affective commitment (AC); Leader-member exchange (LMX); Transformational leadership; Turnover behavior; Turnover intention,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883749924&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2013.07.005&partnerID=40&md5=249e820b7130307f155144d175768899

A social network is a social structure made up of nodes connected by a set of ties. Social capital, in turn, refers to the structure, content, and perception of one's social relationships in the network. This paper presents an in-depth survey of the methods of using SNSC in leadership and management research. I first review how network scholars determine network boundaries, choose sampling techniques, and collect network data. I follow with a comprehensive survey of the statistical tools and analytical strategies prevalent in SNSC research. I then investigate the methodological rigor of 110 SNSC empirical studies in leadership and other management fields. My results show that 8.1% (3/37) specified network boundaries, 43.2% (49/103) used surveys to collect network data, and 52.3% (58/110) implemented at least one reviewed method. A further assessment reveals that only 39.7% (23/58) of papers somewhat justified the appropriateness of using such methods. The frequency distribution of coding criteria was similar across journals and over time.

Based on the assumptions of relational models of procedural justice and prior research done in the multifoci justice framework, we hypothesize that the extent to which a supervisor is seen to embody and represent key in-group attributes will moderate the interaction between the supervisor's own interactional justice and the overall organizational procedural justice. Specifically, organizational justice is expected to decrease employees' feelings of threat particularly when the supervisor treats group members fairly and is perceived to be in-group representative rather than non-representative. We found support for this hypothesis across two studies, a cross-sectional survey and a scenario experiment. The findings confirm the particularly powerful role that an in-group representative leader's interactional fairness has in managing group members' responses to fundamental organizational processes.

We advocate an alternative approach: assessing the link of leader behaviors to outcomes at the lower level of events, where adaptive leader responses and their variable influence on subsequent outcomes can be better assessed. To illustrate the potential benefits of an event-level approach, we first define events and how they differ by developing a taxonomy consisting of seven event dimensions. Important leadership implications of each event dimension are briefly discussed. We then apply our taxonomy to three existing theories of leadership to highlight its value in understanding performance. Strategies for measuring and researching leadership performance with our taxonomy are then introduced and discussed. Finally, event dimensions are used to address questions of critical significance to future leadership theory, such as determining what type of leadership is needed and ascertaining the leadership skills that are most likely to result in effective performance. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Events; Leadership behavior; Leadership performance; Levels of analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880747121&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2013.03.009&partnerID=40&md5=2450b0f7a4550d4cb3facd97594de45f

An identity is important to one's sense of self and it influences the way a leader cognitively processes socially relevant information and exercises a particular leadership behavior in response to a situation. Unlike existing studies, which typically approach servant leadership as one of a number of possible leadership styles, and which merely describe its characteristics, this paper serves to explain the basis for individuals enacting this mode of leadership. This paper defines and elaborates on the servant identity by showing the psychological factors constituting it. Taking a socio-cognitive approach, the paper offers a theoretical framework for the servant identity. The framework encompasses the cognitive and behavioral disposition of leaders with servant identity and the organizational contexts that influence it.

In contrast, we proposed that other dimensions of transformational leadership, such as individualized consideration, would be associated with reduced levels of anxiety and, ultimately, improved workplace outcomes. Results generally supported the hypothesized indirect relationships for ratings of organizational commitment, but not self-reported job performance which was most strongly predicted by individualized consideration, directly.

Specifically, we examined how a leader's enactment-that is, a leader's physical actions-(Study 1, n=. 105) and a combination of leader enactment and life storytelling (Study 2, n=. 334) influenced followers' perceptions of the leader's authenticity, and how this may impact leadership outcomes. The results of these studies, in which leader enactment in the context of authentic leadership was operationalized for the first time, indicate that leader enactment predicts perceived leader authenticity.

Findings show that while science productivity and reputation are strongly associated with having either a center or discipline leadership position, they are less strongly associated with administrative leadership. Also, larger and more dense collaboration networks predict having a center leadership position, but the opposite is true for holding an administrative leadership position. Women are more likely to be in discipline leadership positions and less likely to be a leader of a research center or have an administrative university leadership position.

We take two novel approaches: 1) the introduction of economic game theory to psychological studies of leadership, and 2) the application of the leadership ontology of Drath et al. (2008) as a cross-disciplinary integrative framework. Leadership here is focused on the presence or absence of direction, alignment, and commitment as well as antecedent beliefs and practices that are held within a collective (for us, our experimental participants). Our leadership context is stripped down to very minimal conditions: three group members, an investment decision, and the introduction of information regarding group members' attitudes toward risk.

Our purpose was to test the relationship between personality, servant leadership, and critical follower and organizational outcomes. Using a social influence framework, we proposed that leader agreeableness and extraversion affect follower perceptions of servant leadership. In turn, servant leaders ignite a cycle of service by role-modeling servant behavior that is then mirrored through coworker helping behavior and high-quality customer service, as well as reciprocated through decreased withdrawal. Using a multilevel, multi-source model, we surveyed 224 stores of a U.S. retail organization, including 425 followers, 110 store managers, and 40 regional managers. Leader agreeableness was positively and extraversion was negatively related to servant leadership, which was associated with decreased follower turnover intentions and disengagement. At the group-level, service climate mediated the effects of servant leadership on follower turnover intentions, helping and sales behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Helping behavior; Personality; Servant leadership; Service climate; Turnover intentions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875098916&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2012.12.001&partnerID=40&md5=52aee0ba056146eb4cc35651e4907666

Using data collected in two time points (N=200, 1. year apart), we found perceptions of transformational leadership (Time 1) to be positively related to the use of soft and rational upward influence tactics (Time 2) whereas transactional leadership (Time 1) was positively related to the use of soft and hard upward influence tactics (Time 2). We also found support for a 3-way interaction between transformational-transactional leadership, relative Leader Member Exchanges (RLMX) and Perceived Organizational Support (POS) on employees' upward influence tactics. Specifically, in resource-constrained conditions (low RLMX and low POS), employees were likely to use soft tactics to influence a manager they perceived as transformational to a greater extent than in resource-munificent conditions. They were also likely to employ higher levels of soft and hard tactics to influence a transactional manager in resource-constrained rather than in resource-munificent conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",LMX; Perceived organizational support; Transformational leadership; Upward influence,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875097753&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2012.11.007&partnerID=40&md5=ff74e8119509ce2d5fa84ea4fb253d45

Specifically, subordinates had low role ambiguity and low intrinsic motivation when leaders' and subordinates' empowerment expectations matched at low levels and when leaders underestimated subordinates' empowerment expectations. However, subordinates had low role ambiguity and high intrinsic motivation when expectations matched at high levels.

The argument draws on evidence from ten comparative cases, exploring links between leadership patterns and organizational outcomes. Our analysis builds three themes. First, a pattern of widely distributed change leadership is linked to delivering improvements in service outcomes. Second, professional/managerial hybrids are shown to perform crucial lateral facilitation activities, adapting and extending their roles to suit their organizational context. Third, a foundation of good pre-existing relationships underpins the capacity of distributed leadership to implement service improvements. Conversely, poor relationships and conflicts erode the concerted capacity of distributed change leadership.

The association between leader trait anger and subordinate-reported petty tyranny was strongest among low trait anger subordinates supporting the theory of temperamental goodness-of-fit-or rather misfit-in dyads. Hence, leader anger-generated petty tyranny seems to constitute itself both as an average leadership style and as behavior targeting specific subordinates, in this case low trait anger subordinates.

Some implications for psychological theory on leadership,Leadership Quarterly,2013,"This paper deals with some principles derived from the concept of psychological distance, which are relevant to the differential view of distant and close leaders as perceived by the followers. The claim is that psychological distance is a subjective dimension that affects the manner of construal and attributions with regard to leaders. The more distant the leaders in the followers' perception the more they will be construed in abstract categories; more weight will be attributed to them in explaining occurrences of events; the followers will relate more to their traits and less to their behaviors, and will derive from their image more meaning for their own self worth.

However, based on expectancy violations and psychological contracts research, we also predicted that expectation fulfillment would moderate this relationship.

Yet, such claims are often based on an arbitrary selection of elections, and inadequate statistical analysis. Using data on all presidential elections, we show that height is indeed an important factor in the US presidential elections. Candidates that were taller than their opponents received more popular votes, although they were not significantly more likely to win the actual election. Taller presidents were also more likely to be reelected. In addition, presidents were, on average, much taller than men from the same birth cohort. The advantage of taller candidates is potentially explained by perceptions associated with height: taller presidents are rated by experts as 'greater', and having more leadership and communication skills.

We propose that both leader happiness and leader sadness can be beneficial for follower performance contingent on whether the task concerns creative or analytical performance. This proposition was put to the test in two experiments in which leader affective display was manipulated and the performance of (student) participants was assessed. The results supported our hypothesis that a leader's displays of happiness enhance follower creative performance, whereas a leader's displays of sadness enhance follower analytical performance. Contrasting these findings with evidence for a subjective rating of leadership effectiveness, in line with an implicit leadership theory interpretation, leaders were perceived as more effective when displaying happiness rather than sadness irrespective of task type. The second study showed that the effects of leader affective displays on followers' creative performance and perceived leadership effectiveness are mediated by follower positive affect, indicating that emotional contagion partly underlies these effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Creativity; Happiness; Leader affect; Leadership effectiveness; Sadness,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872371865&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2012.09.003&partnerID=40&md5=6a7e5f74988a329d1594de989e2c0556

To illustrate these notions, we provide an in-depth review of 163 multi-level empirical leader-member exchange (LMX) and vertical dyad linkage (VDL) studies published between 1972 and 2012. Our findings indicate that the volume of multi-level studies in LMX has drastically increased recently and the majority of these studies cast theory and hypotheses at the same level. With regard to alignment of levels of theory/hypotheses with measurement and with data analyses, however, roughly one out of two published studies suffers from misalignment of levels. Most of this misalignment occurs in studies where the dyad level of analysis, a key component of LMX, is an explicit or implicit focus.

However, its impact on interpersonal relationships and consequently on organizational functioning remains understudied. The present study addresses these gaps by: a) exploring the spillover effect of organizational cynicism on supervisor-subordinate relationships, and b) examining if the spillover effect extends to employee performance. Specifically, it examines if affective commitment to the supervisor mediates the relationship between the PSS × organizational cynicism interaction effect and performance (i.e., mediated-moderation). Data were collected from both employees and supervisors (N = 274) from 45 organizations. Our results generally support our hypotheses.

In this study both leader- and subordinate ratings of leader personality and leadership styles are employed to inspect the relations between HEXACO Honesty-Humility, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness on the one hand and Ethical, Charismatic, Supportive, and Task-oriented leadership on the other. Using an instrumental variable procedure, strong direct effects of Honesty-Humility on Ethical leadership, Extraversion on Charismatic leadership, Agreeableness on Supportive leadership, and Conscientiousness on Task-oriented leadership were observed.

The effects of sense of power and belongingness on leader self-sacrifice.,Leadership Quarterly,2012,"Past research on leader self-sacrifice has focused entirely on the effects of this leader behavior on followers and its implications for organizations. The present research focused on antecedents of leader self-sacrifice. We argued that self-sacrifice is positively influenced by leaders' sense of belongingness to the group they supervise. Furthermore, leaders' subjectively sensed power can serve as a moderator of this effect. We expected this because a high sense of power is known to facilitate goal pursuit. Given that organizational goals often prescribe serving the interests of the organization, leaders' sense of belongingness should promote self-sacrifice particularly among leaders low in subjective power; leaders high in subjective power should display self-sacrifice regardless of their sense of belongingness. Two field studies supported these predictions. A final experiment supported a critical assumption underlying our argument in showing that the sense of power × sense of belongingness interaction is restricted to situations that prescribe cooperative goals.

Employees (N= 1214) in 46 branches of a large Dutch bank rated branch management on charismatic leadership, organizational culture in terms of work practices, as well as perceived organizational performance. Objective performance data were collected twice, two years apart. The split sample technique attenuated common source bias. Results of structural equation modeling, in which Time 1 financial performance measures were controlled, revealed that charisma increased financial performance; however culture did not do so. Culture and charisma were significantly related to perceived performance, and culture and charisma were interrelated.

Based on the analysis of similarities between Western and Eastern moral philosophy and ethics principles of the world religions, the present approach identifies four essential normative reference points of ethical leadership - the four central ethical orientations: (1) humane orientation, (2) justice orientation, (3) responsibility and sustainability orientation, and (4) moderation orientation. Research propositions on predictors and consequences of leader expressions of the four central orientations are offered.

Results from 155 participants in leaderless group discussions supported this hypothesis. Further, relative weight analysis revealed that observer ratings of extraversion explained the largest percentage of variance in leadership, followed by self ratings of openness to experience and observer ratings of openness to experience.

These leaders within the organization, often referred to as middle managers, occupy an important, albeit overlooked position within an organization. In order to emphasize the leadership that occurs at the middle levels of management the term 'embedded leader' is used. Using a sample of 224 undergraduates, three variables were manipulated to examine their effects on participant sensemaking, confidence, and participative leadership. The variables manipulated were the severity of individual level consequences (high vs. low), the severity of organizational consequences (high vs. low), and the superior's motivational strategy (coercive vs. supportive vs. passive style). It was found that a leader's superior can influence their leadership behaviors in a complex manner. Participant sensemaking was higher when their superior emphasized low levels of individual (or personal) consequences. Participative leadership was higher when the supervisor framed organizational level consequences as being high. Findings for participant confidence were complex, but generally suggest that one's superiors can promote or hinder confidence in a variety of situations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Coercive leadership; Embedded leadership; Leader follower relationships; Leader sensemaking; Leadership; Middle management; Supportive leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860326251&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2011.08.008&partnerID=40&md5=b0f044f4df0ed27ecf3844644da9bfb6

The current study examines whether leaders are perceived as more effective when they have 'feminine', 'masculine' or 'androgynous' characteristics, and how this relates to the leader's and followers' sex. Using carefully matched samples of 930 employees of 76 bank managers, we studied the relationship between managers' gender-role identity (perceived 'femininity', 'masculinity' and 'androgyny') and how this relates to leadership effectiveness in terms of transformational leadership and personal identification with the leader. Our findings show that among both male and female leaders, 'androgyny' was more strongly related to transformational leadership and followers' identification than 'non-androgyny', and that leaders' 'femininity' was more strongly related to leadership effectiveness than 'masculinity'. Furthermore, the results show that women paid a higher penalty for not being perceived as 'androgynous' (mixing 'femininity' and 'masculinity'), in comparison to men with regard to personal identification. When examining same- versus cross-sex relationships, we found that 'non-androgynous' male managers were rated higher by their male employees than by their female employees. Our findings suggest that women and men who are interested in being perceived as effective leaders may be well advised to blend 'feminine' and 'masculine' behaviors, and even more so when they are in situations of non-congruency (i.e., women in leadership roles and leading in cross-sex relationships).

We argue that adaptive problems such as those concerning intergroup conflict or cooperation activate different cognitive leadership prototypes, and the face conveys diagnostic information about the suitability and emergence of intergroup leadership.

Furthermore, individuals prefer leaders whose facial cues match the adaptive problem. For example, a masculine-looking leader is preferred in a competitive intergroup setting. Also, this match between face and situation is reinforced with a consistent leadership message such as a masculine-looking leader expressing the need for competition.

This paper therefore explores-from a strategic management perspective-how leadership development practices may contribute to social capital development. We chose the strategic context of a large multibusiness firm in which social capital across business units play an important role for competitive advantage. The exploratory case study reveals that: 1) Social capital differs regarding its intensity and develops through stages characterized by contact, assimilation, and identification experiences. 2) Leadership development practices differ in their potential contribution to social capital development stages and should therefore be designed accordingly. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Corporate management; Corporate strategy; Cross-business synergies; Leadership development; Social capital; Strategy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856071065&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2011.11.014&partnerID=40&md5=b845e6f325c88ff2179de372d0743394

As the foundation for our study, we used self-reported limitations sections of empirical articles as an alternative, novel, and context-sensitive index of state-of-science. Limitations reported in the one-hundred and seventy-four empirical articles published in The Leadership Quarterly to date were coded according to traditional threats to validity. Our results indicate that LQ articles mostly report limitations related to external validity issues. Also, a growing concern with internal validity was noted. These findings offer a unique perspective on leadership research, one that paints a considerably different picture than that offered from previous empirical reviews.

Although prior attention has been given to gender differences in leadership style and leader effectiveness, the moderating effects of the sex of the leader and subordinate on the leadership-leader effectiveness relationship have not been investigated. In a field study of employees from a manufacturing plant, we examined whether leader and subordinate sex, and the sex composition of the leader-subordinate dyad, moderated the linkages of each set of leader behaviors (i.e., TL and LMX) with actual evaluations of leader effectiveness provided by the leader's subordinates and direct supervisor.

Leaders could be expected to rely on these regulatory techniques, as their work roles demand an ability to convey meaning through emotions that may or may not be authentically felt. In this study, we examined how different forms of emotion regulation, as engaged in by those in leadership roles, influence follower job attitudes and behaviors. We predicted that follower perceptions of the leader-member exchange relationship would moderate main effect relationships. Survey results collected from 126 employed individuals indicated that LMX quality influenced follower reactions to the form of emotion regulation engaged in by supervisors. Specifically, deep acting was positively associated with job satisfaction for members in low-quality exchanges, while surface acting negatively affected participation in prosocial acts for individuals in high-quality exchanges.

Consensus composition assumes there is sufficient within-group agreement with respect to the leadership construct of interest; in the absence of agreement, the aggregate leadership construct is untenable. At the same time, guidelines to help leadership researchers make decisions regarding data aggregation issues have received little explicit attention. In particular, a discussion of how data aggregation decisions can enhance or obscure a study's theoretical contribution - a central focus of this article - has not been addressed thoroughly. Recognizing that empirical generalization depends on the accuracy with which aggregation decisions are applied, we revisit the often neglected assumptions associated with the most common agreement statistic used to justify data aggregation - r WG and r WG(J) (James, Demaree, and Wolf, 1984). Thereafter, using a dataset published as part of a Leadership Quarterly special issue (Bliese, Halverson, &amp; Schriesheim, 2002), we highlight the potential misuse of r WG and r WG(J) as the sole statistic to justify aggregation to a higher level of analysis.

Transformation leadership theory is one of the most widely studied and accepted theories in Western countries and is viewed as a universalistic leadership approach. The nurturant-task leadership model was developed in India and viewed as a culture-specific leadership approach. We also developed a local leadership model, called RDO, a pseudonym for the organization, and viewed it as an organization-specific leadership approach, using a qualitative analysis of interview data. The overall results of our qualitative-quantitative work provide strong support for the RDO leadership model, some support for a nurturant-task leadership model, and minimal support for transformational leadership theory.

In this paper we argue that Authentic Leadership (AL), in the way it is currently theorized, is in danger of not reaching its stated objectives. We systematically address the ""paradoxes"" and shortcomings in current theory and suggest an extended focus of study. To do so, we draw on four existential authenticity themes: 1) inauthenticity is inevitable; 2) authenticity requires creating one's own meaning; 3) authenticity does not imply goal and value congruence, 4) authenticity is not intrinsically ethical. We systematically pursue the implications of these themes for the future development of Authentic Leadership theory and propose a more radical form of AL in which the focus of study shifts from the individual leader to understanding the conditions under which all members of the organization behave authentically. We suggest this is more likely to achieve the objectives of Authentic Leadership theory. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Authentic; Ethical; Existential; Leadership; Meaning; Power,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856033036&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2011.11.010&partnerID=40&md5=57f5009be9134161b40b014ea242885f

The model was tested on a sample of 95 service employees and on 485 interactions between these employees and their customers.

In a naturalistic field study, we found that rater personality (i.e., agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness) was positively associated with ratings of transformational leadership, but significant rater personality effects were not found in an experimental study where leadership behavior was invariant. These results suggest that disagreements among raters about leaders' behaviors are not due solely to random error and may instead reflect true differences either in (a) the behaviors leaders exhibit toward individual followers or (b) personality-related differences between followers in attention to and recall of leadership behaviors. We also found that personality (of subordinates and peers) was not randomly distributed across leaders, though clustering effects were generally small. Practically, our results suggest that (a) individual reports of leadership may be better at predicting leadership outcomes than aggregated group reports - especially those related to individual attitudes and behaviors - though they are rarely used in the literature; (b) aggregation is complicated because rater personality is associated with leadership ratings and is not randomly distributed across leaders; and (c) corrections for measurement error based on inter-rater agreement may not be appropriate due to non-random unique rater variance. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Aggregation; Leadership; Personality; Rating error,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856026630&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2011.11.011&partnerID=40&md5=218acb6ba563ae86ed73ba6da1250595

792,Riad S.,Invoking Cleopatra to examine the shifting ground of leadership,Leadership Quarterly,2011,"This essay argues that the understanding of leadership is not independent of the power relations within a given cultural context. These shape how 'leadership' comes to be 'known' - defined and identified. Drawing from cultural studies, it examines the interacting dynamics of power, difference and context in shaping our knowledge of leadership. So whereas we currently identify leadership in Cleopatra, this is due to shifts in the contemporary ground of knowledge that constitutes 'leadership'. Specifically, the essay focuses on manifestations of gendered power that elicited changes in her appraisals. The analysis examines historical writing (Plutarch), literature (Shakespeare), art (Egyptian Revival) and film (Hollywood) to illustrate gendered paradoxes - criteria that had traditionally defined 'leaders' from 'followers', but which have become ambiguous. These include queen-lover (embodiment), public-domestic (sphere of work and influence), sage-child (intellect), white-black (racialized identity) and Rome-Egypt (international leadership).

Most research examining ethical leadership has focused on the leader characteristics and subordinate outcomes associated with ethical leadership, but research examining the situational variables influencing leader ethical decision-making is limited. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine a number of situational variables that may influence leader ethical decision-making. This study examined the impacts of performance pressure, interpersonal conflict, the leader's decision-making autonomy, the type of ethical issue at hand, and the level of authority of the other person involved in the interaction. The results indicated that when making a decision in response to a superior (as opposed to a peer or subordinate), leaders make worse decisions.

Since the leader and subordinate are jointly embedded in the relationship, it is reasonable to assume that their ratings of their relationship will converge to some reasonable extent. However, leader-member convergence on the most widely used measures, the LMX-7 and SLMX-7 scales, has historically been low. To address this, we conduct two studies to investigate whether item wording and content might be a cause of poor LMX convergence. The obtained results support the conclusion that the wording and content of these measures are, in fact, introducing attributional and social desirability biases into the rating process and causing some of the poor LMX convergence that is commonly seen.

Prior research has suggested that leadership emergence and performance of narcissistic personalities may depend on contextual factors. Of particular interests are those contextual factors that pertain to the interdependence of work relationships, because narcissists typically tend to 'shine' in social settings where they can influence others. Therefore, the present study investigated the leadership emergence and performance of narcissistic individuals in low versus high reward interdependent teams that participated in an interactive team simulation task.

The results of analyses interview transcripts of leaders nominated as wise persons indicate that: 1) incidents of wisdom involved leadership, 2) the process definition of wisdom describes the incidents of wisdom leaders reported on, and 3) leadership-related wisdom was more likely to be displayed at the societal, and at the organizational levels through fulfilling visions, solving problems, and founding organizations.

Study 1 was an online experiment in which behavioral integrity was manipulated in written scenarios; Study 2 was a field study; and Study 3 was a longitudinal lab study with temporary work teams. Findings from the studies indicated that leader behavioral integrity was not directly related to follower job performance, but was related indirectly via trust in the leader and follower satisfaction with the leader. Results also indicated that follower behavioral integrity had a significant impact on job performance, both directly and indirectly via leader trust in the follower and satisfaction with the follower. Finally, results indicated that perceptions of behavioral integrity were based primarily on individual differences and not higher level-of-analysis effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Behavioral integrity; Ethics; Job performance; Leadership; Satisfaction; Trust,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960450813&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2011.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=4fd035190d9d018b6491b578641ef73b

More recently, however, scholars have begun to emphasize the pivotal role of followers in the development of leaders.

Academic intrinsic motivation, the pleasure inherent in an activity for its own sake with regard to school learning, provided the construct that was assessed from childhood through adolescence, and motivation to lead comprising three aspects (affective identity, noncalculative, and social normative) was assessed during adulthood. The Fullerton Longitudinal Study (FLS) provided the data. Using structural equation modeling, results showed considerable and significant continuity between academic intrinsic motivation and, as predicted, affective identity and noncalculative motivation to lead, indicating that adults with a greater enjoyment of leadership per se, and who are motivated to lead without regard to external consequences, were significantly more intrinsically motivated from childhood through adolescence. On the other hand, also as predicted, academic intrinsic motivation was not significantly related to the social normative aspect of motivation to lead, indicating that those who are motivated to lead out of a sense of social duty were not more intrinsically motivated during their childhood years.

Based on recent theorizing on leader development (Day, Harrison, & Halpin, 2009), it was predicted that adopting a leader identity would serve as a within-person, time-varying covariate of leadership effectiveness and that goal orientation would serve as a between-person, cross-level moderator of the personal change trajectories.

The better the match, the more favorable subordinates' attitudes toward their leaders will be. We suggest, however, that subordinates not only perceive their leaders against the backdrop of a leader prototype but also themselves. Based on socio-cognitive research, we hypothesize that these self-perceptions in turn should lend more weight to the leader prototype as a benchmark. Three field studies with employees ( N= 87; N= 265; N= 385) were undertaken to test our hypothesis. Results confirm that subordinates' perceptions of their leaders against an ideal leader prototype are related to subordinates' respect for their leaders and leadership effectiveness perceptions, and that these relationships are moderated by subordinates' self-perceptions against the ideal leader prototype.

Recognizing that the relationship between leader behavior and team performance is indirect, we further examined whether team empowerment served as a mediating mechanism through which transformational leadership is evoked. Study results, based on ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses and bootstrapped estimates, were consistent with the hypothesized conceptual scheme of moderated mediation, in that the joint effects of transformational leadership behavior and consensus about transformational leadership were found to have an indirect effect on team performance through team empowerment.

A study of 58 middle managers from two companies in Denmark; a private accountancy firm and a public elderly care explored this. Using the Experience Sampling Method and questionnaires it was found that both situational factors and working conditions were associated with transformational leadership behaviors at work. The results suggest that research strategies using multiple levels and methods can provide additional information on the antecedents of transformational leadership behaviors in middle managers. © 2011.",Experience sampling method; Middle managers; Multi-level analyses; Transformational leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79955474118&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2011.02.009&partnerID=40&md5=a387e62e6485c88d04e54a9343669146

The research involved a multiple case study method to examine typical champion-driven leadership processes in six urban water management agencies. The analysis indicated that these leadership processes evolved through three distinct phases characterized by different forms of leadership, involved many leaders, and were strongly affected by context. The research produced a new, three-phase conceptual model of champion-driven leadership. This model is used to explain the way in which the transformational, distributed and complexity models of leadership are relevant to different dimensions of champion-driven leadership processes as they evolve. The model is also used to explain why some champions are more effective than others.

Apart from giving an insight into the variety and patterns of leadership practices observed in these clusters, the paper addresses the dilemma that regional innovation systems such as clusters usually have a critical need of some kind of leadership, but that neither individual nor organizational actors wish to be led. This dilemma or paradox can only be 'managed' by organizing for leading (in) clusters in a way that takes into account the tensions and contradictions surrounding leadership of and in clusters.

Nevertheless, leadership research has inherently reflected shifting views of knowledge, transitioning from an emphasis on the classical symbolic view to connectionism and most recently to an embodied, embedded view of cognition. We argue that different leadership processes uniquely draw on these three types of knowledge and that excluding a connectionist or embodied, embedded view of knowledge creates an impoverished understanding of leadership. To illustrate this problem, we provide two follower-centric and two leader-centric examples of leadership processes which rely on the multiple forms of knowledge described herein: followers' attributional reasoning regarding leadership, followers' perceptions and memories of leaders, processes that generate leaders' behavioral choices, and finally, leaders' sensemaking/decision-making.

Video-taped extracts from speeches given by seven people widely regarded as influential thought leaders - Kenneth Blanchard, Stephen Covey, Daniel Goleman, Gary Hamel, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Tom Peters and Peter Senge - were shown to different audiences. After viewing each extract they rated the extent to which they found the speaker charismatic or non-charismatic and why. In addition, the whole speeches and focal messages were content analysed for the presence a number of factors - delivery, rhetorical techniques, abstraction and inclusion - identified in the previous literature as underpinning charismatic oratory. When the speeches are taken as a whole the speakers rated as charismatic differed significantly from their non-charismatic counterparts only in terms of delivery.

We also explore how the outcome of grounded theory research can create a dissonance between theories that resonate with the reality they are designed to explore, and the theories that resonate with a particular yet dominant 'scientific' approach in the field of leadership studies - the philosophy of science commonly known as positivism. We examine the opportunities provided by an alternative philosophy of science, that of critical realism. We explore how conducting grounded theory research informed by critical realism might strengthen researchers' confidence to place emphasis on an understanding and explanation of contextualised leadership as a scientific goal, rather than the scientific goal of generalization through empirical replication.

Forty-two employees first filled in a general questionnaire, and then a diary survey over five consecutive workdays. The results of multilevel analyses offered partial support for our hypotheses.

The results indicated that in dyadic relationships characterized by strong IL, followers determined whether their superiors would support their sense of self-worth and thus come to view their superiors as leaders. In so doing, follower behaviors contributed to the initiation of these effective leadership relationships and did so while being influenced by three sets of contextual moderators: individual characteristics of the leader, interpersonal dynamics, and developmental factors.

In line with hypotheses, the results indicate that while surveillance may be a necessary tool in the repertoire of outgroup leaders (Experiment 2), in the hands of ingroup leaders it is likely to attenuate rather than enhance their capacity to influence (Experiments 1 and 2). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Influence; Leadership; Power; Self-categorization; Social identity; Surveillance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951721558&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2010.12.014&partnerID=40&md5=f7f79e6e78fd547f4cb59b79c7d225b7

The first study investigated the accuracy of descriptive gender stereotypes about leadership styles, showing that participants accurately believe that women display more transformational and contingent reward behaviors, and fewer management-by-exception and laissez-faire behaviors than men. The second study investigated prescriptive stereotypes about the importance of leadership styles for the promotion of women and men to different levels in organizations. Inspirational motivation was perceived as more important for men than women and especially important for promotion to CEO. In contrast, individualized consideration was perceived as more important for women than men and especially important for promotion to senior management. Consistent with these stereotypical beliefs about leadership, women interested in promotion may be well advised to blend individualized consideration and inspirational motivation behaviors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Gender roles; Promotion; Sex differences; Stereotype accuracy; Transformational leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951720590&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2010.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=154d9232489a1a7ab3ba28b22c325b86

Based on theory, interviews and a student sample, we developed seven ethical leader behaviors (fairness, integrity, ethical guidance, people orientation, power sharing, role clarification, and concern for sustainability). We then tested the factor structure in two employee samples (first common-source, EFA; next multi-source, CFA). To establish construct validity we related ethical leader behaviors to other leadership styles and employee attitudes in Study 1. The expected pattern of relationships emerged, e.g., positive relationships with satisfaction and commitment, and negative ones with cynicism. The results suggest that the ELW scales have sound psychometric properties and good construct validity. In Study 2, using a multi-source sample, the ELW behaviors explained variance in trust, OCB, and leader and follower effectiveness beyond a uni-dimensional measure of ethical leadership. Ethical leadership was also related to OCB (supervisor-rated). Employees who rate their leader higher on power sharing and fairness show more OCB. Taken together, the results suggest that the ELW is a useful new multidimensional measurement tool that can help further our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of ethical leadership. © 2010.",Construct validation; Ethical leadership; Organizational citizenship behavior; Scale development,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951684910&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2010.12.007&partnerID=40&md5=3b259e6a2c8d57412b678d63f79dd914

However, little research has focused on the role that leaders play, if any, in influencing, developing and/or fostering shared mental models and thereby improving team performance. We developed an agent-based computational model based on McComb's theory of three-phase mental model development, where agents repeatedly share individual opinions (orientation phase), evaluate and respond to the opinions expressed by others (differentiation phase), and modify their understanding of the team based on the responses (integration phase). Leadership and team properties are represented in three experimental parameters: social network structure, heterogeneity of agents' domains of expertise, and level of their mutual interest. Participative leadership is represented by a fully connected network, while Leader-Member eXchange (LMX) is represented by a fully connected network of in-group members and several out-group members connected only to the leader. Our simulation results show that, in general, participative leadership promotes mental model convergence better than LMX. In the meantime, the team performance improvement is achieved by participative leadership only when members have both heterogeneous domains of expertise and strong mutual interest. In all other conditions, participative leadership causes the worst degradation of team performance through team development processes, while LMX is the best to minimize such team degradation.

Federal systems provide alternative mechanisms for managing change and organizational leadership. Terms are defined to derive a model of turf disputes. This model is applied to the historical case of the 'turf war' between a U.S. President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the U.S. Senate over his 1937 attempt to 'pack' the U.S. Supreme Court. This leads to a more general discussion of turf disputes and their occurrence.

When can these claims be made? We answer this question by first discussing design and estimation conditions under which model estimates can be interpreted, using the randomized experiment as the gold standard. We show how endogeneity - which includes omitted variables, omitted selection, simultaneity, common-method variance, and measurement error - renders estimates causally uninterpretable. Second, we present methods that allow researchers to test causal claims in situations where randomization is not possible or when causal interpretation could be confounded; these methods include fixed-effects panel, sample selection, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences models. Third, we take stock of the methodological rigor with which causal claims are being made in a social sciences discipline by reviewing a representative sample of 110 articles on leadership published in the previous 10. years in top-tier journals. Our key finding is that researchers fail to address at least 66% and up to 90% of design and estimation conditions that make causal claims invalid.

To further explore this topic, 170 undergraduates were assigned to one of five work conditions and asked to read three cases with initiating structure problems and three cases with consideration problems while taking on the role of the CEO in the scenario. Errors committed by leaders were examined to answer questions about how work conditions influence errors committed. Additionally, how these errors influence performance outcomes was also examined. Results indicated that work conditions paired with errors made by leaders influenced levels of performance.

Using the experience of Lech Wałe{ogonek}sa's transition from the leader of the Solidarity social movement to the president of Poland as a case study, this article evaluates the portability of leadership skills and informal authority to the changing operational context of constituted leadership. It argues that the constraints of formal authority are significantly higher than those imposed on non-constituted leaders. As a result, while constituted leaders may have greater resources available to broadcast power, the allocation of these resources entails higher expectation for their custodians.

Using data from two samples, we supported our hypothesis that leader relational identity moderates relationships of leader-member exchange (LMX) with subordinate task performance and citizenship behaviors. The nature of the interaction was such that the negative relationships of low-quality LMX with performance are mitigated when subordinates had supervisors with strong relational identities.

We examine organizational centralization, formalization, and size as antecedents of an organization's TFL climate, and as moderators of the relationship between TFL climate and productive organizational energy (POE). Hypotheses are tested using a sample of 125 organizations. Results show that both the centralization and size of an organization are negatively related to its TFL climate, whereas formalization has a positive association. Further, while there is a positive linkage between TFL climate and POE, both centralization and formalization moderate this relationship. The TFL climate-POE linkage is diminished under conditions of high centralization, and it is enhanced under conditions of high formalization. These findings point to the role of organizational structure as a boundary condition for both the occurrence and the effectiveness of TFL in organizations.

LMX differentiation, in turn, moderates the lower-level effect that LMX has on performance evaluation. Using surveys from leaders and subordinates as well as archival data from six companies, we found support for these arguments.

Second, we present a methodology for utilizing this taxonomy to evaluate whether a given self-development activity, or collection of activities, is higher or lower in effectiveness.

We argue that visions may invite followers to create an ideal self (a desired image of the self). Subsequent consideration of this ideal self may motivate followers to make the ideal self (and thus the vision) reality. Furthermore, we propose that visions that focus on followers (by addressing followers personally and involving them in the vision) are more likely to lead to the creation of an ideal self and hence to higher follower performance than visions that do not focus on followers. Moreover, we argue that this effect is particularly strong for followers with a promotion self-regulatory focus, a focus on reaching ideals and ideal selves, because promotion focus causes sensitivity to the presence or absence of ideals (Higgins, 1987, 1996, 1997).

Leaders self-defining more strongly as leaders relied more on other leaders' self-allocations and on effective leadership beliefs when allocating resources to the self than those self-defining less strongly as leaders.

Past behavioral intention theories, such as the theory of planned behavior, have not accounted for the impact of reasons on decision-making processes. Moreover, behavioral reasoning theory hypothesizes that reasons not only influence leaders' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control to act, they also directly influence leaders' intentions to act (through explicit or implicit processes). We tested theoretical propositions in a special case of executives' decisions to employ youth workforces (N=283). Results demonstrated support for the theory, including its predictive validity over the theory of planned behavior.

Because of the controversial and highly visible nature of these issues, they often face intense criticism. Leaders' responses to criticisms not only affect follower reactions, but also the successful resolution of the contested issue. The present study examines leader and follower reactions to different types of criticisms. A historiometric approach was used to examine biographies containing criticisms of 120 world leaders and to explore leader behaviors in response to criticisms. Specifically, leader response strategies and their success in terms of follower reactions and resolution of the criticism were examined. The results indicated that collaborative or confrontational leader response strategies proved most effective in terms of the leader's ability to continue forward with a particular agenda item and to gather support of those around him or her. Conversely, avoidant, diverting attention, and persuasive response strategies proved less effective. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Criticism; Followers; Historiometric; Leadership; Outstanding leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953683850&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2010.03.003&partnerID=40&md5=966b9ac242532c08e660c50a9dc1d08c

We conducted a short-term longitudinal study using multisource data on 183 teenaged ice hockey players (M age=13.39 years) in 16 hockey teams to test the effects of 3 potentially salient leadership influences (team coaches, team players, and parents) on players' on-ice aggression. We tested a cross-level mediated model in which player aggression (penalty minutes) as measured by referees was the criterion variable. After controlling for prior levels of player aggression, team-level aggression mediated the relationship between team-level coach transformational leadership and player aggression. Parents' transformational leadership did not influence player aggression when assessed simultaneously with team-level coach transformational leadership.

Individuals who engaged in volunteer community leadership reported more altruistic motives (i.e., they volunteered because they were concerned about others). High levels of voluntary community leadership were also associated with social motives, such as getting involved in the community because friends or important others think doing so is important. Regardless of their motives, participants engaged in their communities in new ways following participation in a community leadership program, suggesting that such programs foster integrative community leadership. Programs that focused on team building as part of their curriculum were the most successful in fostering new community leadership activities, and programs that focused on knowledge and awareness of the community were effective in increasing participants' knowledge and awareness of the community.

However, the importance and desirability of charismatic leaders in change processes can be questioned, as well as the notion that charismatic leaders are invariably proponents of change. There are documented cases of charismatic leaders in religious and political contexts who have opposed ongoing change and proposed restoring tradition.

The analysis indicates that the influence processes involved are basically the same as in charismatic leadership in general.

Using data collected from 210 employees and their supervisors, we found that the four variants of trust in organizational leadership were distinguishable, and had differential effects on employee outcomes.

Transformational leadership facilitates both speaking out and speaking up. However, it produces effects on employees via different types of employee identifications. Specifically, social identification predicts only speaking out, while personal identification predicts only speaking up.

In developing our ideas further, we draw from the acting theory of Stanislavski (1936a, 1936b, 1961) to explore how authentic dramatic performances are created, focusing on the role of emotional memory, the magic 'if' and physical action in performances. We propose three key components of a resulting theory of how embodied authentic leadership is created: self exposure, relating, and making leaderly choices. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

646,"Neal M.W., Tansey R.",The dynamics of effective corrupt leadership: Lessons from Rafik Hariri's political career in Lebanon,Leadership Quarterly,2010,"This article introduces the notion of ""effective corrupt leadership"" to distinguish those in public office who engage in corrupt practice, who are more effective, and better for their people, than alternatives. The paper examines a case of such leadership by discussing the career of the late Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese Prime Minister who initiated and achieved the rebuilding of Beirut after the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990. Using the historical case-study method, an examination of Hariri's activities allows us to appreciate the difficulties of achieving tangible welfare benefits in corrupt circumstances. Notably, the moralizing attacks by Hariri's rivals show that while achieving and sustaining political power may require corrupt practice, such practice can ultimately undermine the leader authority and power. This ""blifil paradox"" demonstrates how difficult it is to lead effectively in corrupt circumstances. Through a discussion of these difficulties and challenges, the article attempts to demonstrate the significance of ""effective corrupt leadership"", both in terms of its impact upon people, and its importance for the refinement of our understanding of leadership. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The results indicate significant differences in the meaning of vision articulated for each type of venture. Differences between ventures were also found with regard to the relationship that vision has with the ventures' strategies and performance. In the nonprofit organizations vision was associated with a wide-range strategy as well as the ventures' performance and growth. In addition, wide-range strategy partially mediated the relationship between the ventures' vision and its performance and growth. In business enterprises, vision directly predicted only a differentiation strategy, which also mediated the relationship between vision and the ventures' performance and growth. In contrast, a wide-range strategy in these organizations actually reduced growth.

Using the biopsychosocial model of threat and challenge, this laboratory experiment examined women's cardiovascular, behavioral (i.e., performance), and self-report responses to the negative female leader stereotype as a function of leadership efficacy. Female participants, selected on leadership efficacy scores, served as leaders of ostensible three-person groups within an immersive virtual environment. Half were explicitly primed with the negative stereotype. As predicted, women with high, as opposed to low, percepts of leadership self-efficacy exhibited cardiovascular patterns of threat when performing the leadership task, and they performed better in the explicit stereotype activation condition compared to those not explicitly primed. Additionally, this threat was consistent with positive reactance responses on behavioral and self-report measures. Low efficacy leaders were not threatened, but they did show stereotype priming effects by assimilating to the negative stereotype on the self-report and behavioral measures. This research provides greater insight into stereotype reactance effects and highlights the role of self-efficacy in moderating stereotype threat and stereotype priming effects. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Rather, multiple individuals within the team may serve as leaders in both formal and informal capacities, and the shifting of leadership responsibilities is often rooted in which individual's expertise is most relevant to the given problem. In the present effort, we add to the rapidly growing body of work that focuses on the distribution of the leadership role among multiple individuals. We have reviewed relevant extant literature and proposed an integrated framework for understanding the collective leadership process. Also, in developing this framework we have taken an information and expertise-based approach such that we propose that collective leadership, or the distribution of the leadership role, is a function of selectively utilizing the information or specialized expertise that individuals within the network possess.

Participants' psychological, emotional, and motivational responses to the videos were assessed prior to their engagement with the task. The transformational leadership condition was associated with enhanced task performance, higher social support perceptions, greater efficacy beliefs, lower negative affect, and lower threat appraisals compared to the transactional conditions. Causal modeling revealed that leadership style had a direct, rather than indirect, effect on task performance.

In line with prior findings, we showed how these personality characteristics were relevant to transformational leadership emergence in our face-to-face teams. However, they were largely unrelated to such leadership in the virtual team context. We also focused specifically on the virtual context by analyzing the content of team interactions.

Drawing on psychoanalysis and structuralist film studies, this paper explores leadership emergence as a mythic structure within the four films, arguing that these myths are structured around a struggle of a young novice against an evil power figure, and the overcoming of this figure through a process of self-discovery and maturation. Central themes include the relations between self-realization of leaders and the social harmony, the battle with evil leaders as an ego-struggle, and exile and journey as a precursor to mature leadership competence.

624,"Currie G., Lockett A., Suhomlinova O.",Leadership and institutional change in the public sector: The case of secondary schools in England,Leadership Quarterly,2009,"Leadership should be viewed as being embedded in a societal context and influenced by (as well as influencing) the institutional environment of organizations. Extant research on leadership, however, has largely neglected the effect of the institutional environment. To redress this imbalance we examine leadership in the context of institutional change in secondary school education in England. Specifically, we examine the co-existence of an emerging, government-prescribed, results-oriented approach to leadership (the new institution) with a more traditional professional value-based approach (the old institution). Our methodological approach utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis suggests that there are no significant performance differences between the two leadership approaches. Furthermore, school context does not appear to influence the leadership style employed. The qualitative analysis enabled us to better interpret these findings and to examine the enactment of leadership. The analysis suggests that although the new regulatory environment has fostered the development of the results-oriented leadership, it has not fully replaced professional value-based leadership. Rather, we found pockets of resistance to the policy-prescribed approach precisely in those areas that were targeted by the policy, namely, in schools with high percentage of socially deprived students. We conclude that a complex relationship exists between leadership and its institutional context. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

623,Tranter B.,Leadership and change in the Tasmanian environment movement,Leadership Quarterly,2009,"Semi-structured interviews with key environmentalists conducted in 2002 suggest strategic decision makers, organisational spokespeople and Green politicians are key leaders of the Tasmanian environmental movement, although charismatic leadership persists following movement routinisation. Routinisation is associated with the rise of non-protest environmental movement organisations addressing mainstream issues such as soil erosion, while protest oriented organisations champion the protection of old growth forests. Disproportionate federal government funding of non-protest organisations underpins tensions between movement leaders. An environmental council representing the diverse interests of the groups and organisations comprising the movement mitigates tensions and strengthens leader integration. Entrenched leaders from the 'baby boom' generation hinder the rise of younger leaders. Leader mentoring schemes adopted by movement organisations offer a potential solution to leadership succession in a mature social movement. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, our measures are rarely subjected to systematic assessment of their construct validity. This paper presents arguments about the importance of the construct validation process and illustrates why such concerns are well founded by examining the most commonly used measure of subordinate-perceived leader-member exchange, the LMX-7 scale. Using bakery workers (N = 379) and employed MBA students (N = 350), discriminant validity was investigated by exploratory factor analysis in the first sample, confirmatory factor analysis in the second sample, and correlation and multiple regression analysis in a subset of the second sample (N = 220). The results suggested poor subordinate LMX-7 discriminant validity and that subordinate LMX-7 scores were substantially predicted by measures of supportive leadership and supervisor satisfaction (R2 = .71). Implications for future LMX theory and research are discussed as well as the types of construct validity evidence that we need to gather on our research instruments before and while they are employed in substantive studies of leadership phenomena. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

First, we examined the association of transformational leadership and leader effectiveness across two different cultures, the United States (U.S.) and Korea, with three followers' attitudes toward their leader (trust in the leader, loyalty, and value congruence) as moderators of this association. Second, we conceptualized followers' collectivistic orientation as a personal value, regardless of their nationality, and tested its moderating effect on the leadership-effectiveness association. Finally, we employed a multi-level approach throughout to examine whether transformational leadership processes, and in contrast individualized leadership, operated at different levels of analysis across different countries. Results from WABA and regression analyses indicated that transformational leadership operated at the individual level of analysis in both samples and was effective across different cultures. Specifically, followers' attitudes served as moderators of the transformational leadership-effectiveness association only in the U.S. sample, while collectivistic orientation had a significant moderating effect in both samples. Results from WABA also indicated that individualized leadership operated at the dyadic level for the U.S. sample and at the individual level for the Korean sample.

In our model, leadership at the individual level is manifested in terms of the leader's favoritism toward members and affective displays. Drawing upon affective events theory, we argue that member perceptions of a leader's behaviors and member attributions of insincerity result in negative emotions. Through a process of emotional contagion, the negative emotions then spread to other individuals in the group. These are in turn reflected in the group's affective climate and trust climate, and also in the quality of leader-member and team-member relationships. In the end, this results in organizational-level disapproval of the leader and cynicism towards the leader. Included as moderators in the model are task interdependence, the temporal context, reward systems, emotional labor requirements, organizational culture, and power distance.

By and large, prior studies have emphasized the positive aspects of LMX for employees who have high-quality exchange relationships with their supervisors (e.g., higher job satisfaction, career success). However, given the benefits that tend to accrue to employees in high-quality exchange relationships, workers who have relatively low-quality exchange relationships with their supervisors are likely to be frustrated when they compare their situation to that of their peers. Using the framework outlined by relative deprivation theory, this paper develops a theoretical model identifying when employees with relatively low-quality LMX relationships are most likely to feel aggrieved.

Social dilemma research also shows that leaders feel entitled to earn more, and because of this, are more inclined to contribute less than an equal share to a public good, which may damage the collective. In two experiments, the social dilemma context is used to examine how group members react when either a leader or a follower violates the equality norm. Moreover, we demonstrate how asking for forgiveness sometimes mitigates people's reactions to equality norm violations. Results show that asking for forgiveness attenuates negative emotions, retribution, and non-cooperation-but more so if followers, relative to leaders, violated equality. In fact, leaders are less likely to be seen as even violating norms, suggesting that group members perceive leaders to be entitled. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",Emotions; Equality; Forgiveness; Leadership; Revenge; Social dilemmas,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67349197240&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2009.03.002&partnerID=40&md5=7ff074e420e5e3eb3326dbb4086d93d9

The study of integrity and leadership, though, suffers from a lack of a well-specified theoretical base. This paper addresses this problem by suggesting how integrity, defined as the consistency between words and actions, may be conceptualized at different levels of analysis (individual, group, and organization). Through a series of propositions, we explore how individual leader integrity can affect outcomes such as trust, satisfaction, performance, and follower integrity. We also propose that integrity may be ascribed to groups and organizations, and explore the role that a group leader plays in fostering group- and organization-level integrity and outcomes such as trust and performance.

How leader group prototypicality moderates the effects of leader performance on perceptions of leadership effectiveness,Leadership Quarterly,2009,"Leadership often serves as an explanatory category for performance outcomes (i.e., failure and success). This process can strengthen or weaken leadership effectiveness, because contingent on their performance leaders may gain or lose follower endorsement - the basis of leadership. Drawing on the social identity analysis of leadership, we hypothesized that leader group prototypicality and performance information interact to predict followers' perceptions of leadership effectiveness. Because group prototypical leaders are more trusted by their followers, we hypothesized that group prototypical leaders are evaluated as more effective after failure information than non-prototypical leaders. In contrast, we predicted that both prototypical and non-prototypical leaders should receive similar evaluations of leadership effectiveness after success. We found support for our predictions in a scenario experiment, a cross-sectional field study, and a laboratory experiment. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The entire focus, however, has been on lateral peer-to-peer associations. Prior research has not addressed vertical associations, or the idea that interaction with peer elites yields different perceptions and behaviors than does interaction with parties of lower social status. In this paper, we introduce and develop the concept of elitist association, which we define as a stable behavioral pattern of some corporate executives by which they engage nearly exclusively in associations with other elites while minimizing or even entirely avoiding associations with non-elites. We propose several individual-level antecedents to explain why some executives engage in this behavior more than others. We then discuss the effects of elitist association on executives' access to information, empathy, and social comparison processes - all of which affect their decisions and organizations.

Nevertheless, recent advances in self regulation imply that leaders can instead cultivate such qualities in employees rather than merely attract individuals with these capacities.

First, a framework is developed that integrates four theories of self regulation-self discrepancy theory, personality systems interaction theory, optimal self esteem, and self salience. Second, this framework is applied to demonstrate how fragility undermines adaptive performance. Finally, this framework is used to show how many leadership constructs, such as self sacrificing, moral management, and transformational behavior, can curb this fragility and thus improve adaptive performance.

This paper presents a theoretical model showing how alternative forms of charismatic leadership can be relevant to the implementation of M&As. A unique aspect of our conceptualization is that we recognize the distinction between charismatic leaders with more of a personalized versus socialized power motive, the behaviors emanating from each respective type, and likelihood of resulting effects on the post-combination organization of an M&A. We also propose that personalized charisma will result in an absorption strategy and accompanying stress, resistance to change, and turnover that vary in degree between acquiring and acquired firms. Conversely, socialized charisma will result in collaborative vision-formation and decision-making processes that will ultimately achieve transformation in both of the combining firms. We further argue that absorption strategies can result in effective integration of the target firm into the acquiring firm when the pre-merger condition of the former is unfavorable. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

That it has become a standard concept in general and applied psychology, as well as in applied business settings, is indubitable. Is this popularity warranted? Casting a shadow over the concept of emotional intelligence are concerns about its meaningfulness and the construct and predictive validity of its various measures. The following series of letters explores various issues surrounding emotional intelligence and leadership including: whether emotional intelligence is theoretically needed for leadership, the types of emotional intelligence tests that may hold the most promise, methodological standards for testing whether emotional intelligence matters, evidence from the neuroscience literature on emotions and intelligence, and evidence regarding the links between leader emotional intelligence and follower outcomes. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, studies that have examined the impact of similarity on these relationships have found mixed results, suggesting the need for examining moderators. The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of subordinates' political skill on the relationship between supervisor-subordinate racial similarity/dissimilarity (RSD) and the quality of LMX relationships. The sample consisted of 189 participants in a retail service organization. The results indicate that political skill is a significant moderator, and plays a substantial role in LMX relationship quality for racially dissimilar supervisor-subordinate dyads.

We suggest that leaders approach organizational learning by setting the conditions and structure for learning to occur, while limiting direct interference in the actual creative processes. First, leaders may increase the level of developmental readiness of individual followers, thereby increasing their motivation and ability to approach learning experiences and adapt their mental models. These individuals then serve as catalysts of learning within and between social networks. Second, leaders may promote the diffusion of knowledge between these knowledge catalysts within and across social networks through influencing both the structure and functioning of knowledge networks. Finally, leaders may target actions at the systems level to improve the diffusion to, and institutionalization of, knowledge to the larger organization.",Diffusion; Knowledge catalyst; Knowledge network; Leadership; Multilevel; Organizational learning,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58349092771&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2008.11.003&partnerID=40&md5=1825f14bc58822470d9194ae604d9c19

Our study provides new insights that misfits rather than fits between leadership behaviors and innovative outcomes matter in dynamic environments.

Management programs and systems are usually more effective when they are mutually compatible and appropriate for the situation.

This refers to the phenomenon whereby women are more likely than men to be appointed to leadership positions associated with increased risk of failure and criticism because these positions are more likely to involve management of organizational units that are in crisis. This paper presents three experimental studies (Ns = 95, 85, 83) that represent the first experimental investigations of the glass cliff phenomenon. In these, management graduates (Study 1), high-school students (Study 2) or business leaders (Study 3) selected a leader for a hypothetical organization whose performance was either improving or declining. Consistent with predictions, results indicate that the likelihood of a female candidate being selected ahead of an equally qualified male candidate increased when the organization's performance was declining rather than improving. Study 3 also provided evidence that glass cliff appointments are associated with beliefs that they (a) suit the distinctive leadership abilities of women, (b) provide women with good leadership opportunities and (c) are particularly stressful for women.

Specifically, Plato's theory of the good life challenges contemporary consumer culture and the definition of the good life as desire satisfaction; his critique of democracy raises difficult questions about the ways democracies train and choose leaders; and his account of the ideal regime illustrates the importance and difficulty of taming endemic conflicts between private interests and the public good. At the same time, Plato offers an account of leadership as benefiting the entire community that remains morally attractive.

538,Campbell R.A.,Leadership succession in early Islam: Exploring the nature and role of historical precedents,Leadership Quarterly,2008,"When Muhammad died in 632, he had left no clear indication as to whom if anyone should succeed him as a leader of the Islamic community. According to tradition, both Moses and Jesus before him, as founding figures of Islam's sister Abrahamic faiths Judaism and Christianity, had publicly announced their choices. In the present century, as has been the case for the last fourteen hundred years, Islam is still reeling from the sequence of events that took place over a fifty year period, as leadership of the rapidly growing Muslim community was established and contested. Not only would these events lead to the development of ruling dynasties with hereditary succession, they would also give rise to the major division between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. In what follows, I examine the succession to Muhammad from a history of religions perspective to determine what part the dynamics of succession play in effective leadership practice and in the survival of a social institution. At the same time, in a post-9/11 world, I hope to demonstrate the value of exploring leadership in the context of the world's religious traditions, especially that of Islam. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Using empirical research and anecdotal evidence from the experiences of several high-profile female executives, we argue that women may rise to leadership positions in turbulent environments that are receptive to new talent and open to innovative, bold ideas. Further, we propose that under these conditions women may be seen as especially attractive candidates to guide organizations because they are perceived to utilize a leadership style that promotes openness and inclusion, and facilitates change. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This article focuses on a servant leadership measure that was created by identifying 9 dimensions. Relevant items were then developed and subjected to factor analysis with a sample of 298 students, resulting in a 7-factor solution. Using an organizational sample of 182 individuals, we verified this 7-factor model with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We further validated our 28-item servant leadership scale by regressing outcomes on the servant leadership dimensions, controlling for transformational leadership and leader-member exchange (LMX) in a multi-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis. The results suggest that servant leadership is a multidimensional construct and at the individual level makes a unique contribution beyond transformational leadership and LMX in explaining community citizenship behaviors, in-role performance, and organizational commitment.

The current research investigates whether perceptions of LMX variability (the extent to which LMX relationships are perceived to vary within a team) affects employee job satisfaction and wellbeing beyond the effects of personal LMX quality. As LMX variability runs counter to principles of equality and consistency, which are important for maintaining social harmony in groups, it is hypothesized that perceptions of LMX variability will have a negative effect on employee reactions, via its negative impact on perceived team relations. Two samples of employed individuals were used to investigate the hypothesized relationships. In both samples, an individual's perception of LMX variability in their team was negatively related to employee job satisfaction and wellbeing (above the effects of LMX), and this relationship was mediated by reports of relational team conflict. © 2008.",Conflict; LMX; LMX Variability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-39149141541&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2007.12.002&partnerID=40&md5=d435176ee13b5cda4f06aad95f639e7e

Climate strength is a measure for within-group variability in climate perceptions. We studied groups in 3 military fighting brigades, using a validated military safety-climate questionnaire to check the relationship between safety climate strength and two possible antecedents: leadership (transformational and passive), and interaction with group members (military cohesion). Statistical analysis confirmed our hypotheses. When analyzed separately, cohesion and transformational leadership correlated positively, and passive leadership correlated negatively with climate strength. When cohesion was analyzed in a combined model with passive leadership, both main and interaction effects on climate strength were found. However, when cohesion was included with transformational leadership only the interaction effect was significant. The results suggest that climate strength is influenced both by leadership style and group social interaction, and emphasize the conditions under which each antecedent is relevant to forming consensus.

Its starting point is that although much of the literature about effective leadership practice focuses on leadership behaviours, little is written about the way in which those behaviours are actually enacted. The musician, Bobby McFerrin serves as a case study for identifying three key aspects of leading beautifully: mastery, congruence between form and content, and purpose. These are further considered through reference to the concept of beauty as theorised by the philosophers Plato and Plotinus. The paper then considers how 'leading beautifully' might differ from other conceptualisations of leadership and discusses the particular insight it brings to understanding the nature of leading as a relational phenomenon. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Using computerized content analysis, the current study extended these findings by testing additional communication tactics in temporal sequence on a larger sample of US presidential speeches with an expanded presidential charisma measure. Compared to non-charismatic leaders, charismatic leaders emphasized their similarity to followers in phase 1 and used negation in phase 2.

But while there is general agreement about desired outcomes, the underlying developmental processes associated with these outcomes are not well understood. How do we grow such leaders? This paper reports on a longitudinal study of West Point college students over four years, addressing three questions: (1) do military officer-cadets grow or change in their basic level of psychosocial development [Kegan, R. (1982). The Evolving Self: Problem and Process in Human Development. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.], (2) is the level of psychosocial development related to performance as leaders, and (3) do activities in high school predict later psychosocial development? Two groups of cadets were studied from their freshman or sophomore year to their senior year at the academy. Results show significant positive developmental growth over time for 47% of study participants, with most of this growth occurring from sophomore to senior year. Furthermore, psychosocial development predicts several peer, subordinate and supervisor ratings of cadet performance as leaders during the upperclass (junior and senior) years, a time when cadets take on substantial leadership roles. In addition, early performance ratings by high school teachers, as well as active participation in high school extracurricular activities both predict psychosocial development levels for freshman and sophomores.

Will organizations naturally self-organize to seek greater fitness? We suggest that, as hierarchies, organizations may be collectively led to establish a dynamic system where bottom-up structuration emerges to increase the long-term viability of the organization. Thus, it is our contention that while there is order for free, a desired order is not. To examine if a desired order for free emerges calls for analyses emphasizing the interplay among leadership, organization hierarchy, and CAS perspectives where these are systematically compared and contrasted.

In this view, the behavior and structure of an organization emerges out of the interaction of a collection of organizational agents. Seemingly, there is no role for strategic leadership because the system self-organizes. We argue that strategic leaders play a crucial role in moving organizations to the ""edge of chaos"" and aid in organizational learning and adaptation by influencing the tags that produce the structure of interactions among organizational agents. Through dialogue and storytelling, strategic leaders shape the evolution of agent interactions and construct the shared meanings that provide the rationale by which the past, the present, and the future of the organization coalesce. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These models are eminently effective for an economy premised on physical production but are not well-suited for a more knowledge-oriented economy. Complexity science suggests a different paradigm for leadership-one that frames leadership as a complex interactive dynamic from which adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning, innovation, and adaptability) emerge. This article draws from complexity science to develop an overarching framework for the study of Complexity Leadership Theory, a leadership paradigm that focuses on enabling the learning, creative, and adaptive capacity of complex adaptive systems (CAS) within a context of knowledge-producing organizations. This conceptual framework includes three entangled leadership roles (i.e., adaptive leadership, administrative leadership, and enabling leadership) that reflect a dynamic relationship between the bureaucratic, administrative functions of the organization and the emergent, informal dynamics of complex adaptive systems (CAS). © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

When criteria examining different manifestations of violence were regressed on the discriminant function scores resulting from this comparison of leader types, it was found that attributes of ideological leadership influenced the amount of violence, and the occurrence of institutional and cultural violence - accounting for variance in institutional and cultural violence above and beyond characteristics of leaders, in general, found to contribute to violence.

While research concerning the communication component of leadership has primarily analyzed CEO and presidential communications, this paper utilizes content analysis to provide a descriptive analysis of Chairman Greenspan's communications and his responsiveness to changes in the economic environment.

In contrast, during buoyant periods of economic activity, the Chairman's language indicates a stronger sense of certainty. Such language patterns help the public place their economic circumstances in context, and may contribute to perceptions of Greenspan's effectiveness as a leader. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It was found that transformational and charismatic leadership showed a high convergent validity. Moreover, these leadership styles were divergent from transactional leadership. With regard to criterion validity, subjective (e.g. satisfaction) as well as objective (profit) performance indicators were assessed. Firstly, results indicated that transformational as well as charismatic leadership augmented the impact of transactional leadership on subjective performance. In addition, transformational and charismatic leadership both contribute unique variance to subjective performance, over and above the respective other leadership style. Secondly, transformational leadership had an impact on profit, over and above transactional leadership. This augmentation effect could not be confirmed for charismatic leadership.

In this study, leadership skill requirements are conceptualized as being layered (strata) and segmented (plex), and are thus described using a strataplex. Based on previous conceptualizations, this study proposes a model made up of four categories of leadership skill requirements: Cognitive skills, Interpersonal skills, Business skills, and Strategic skills. The model is then tested in a sample of approximately 1000 junior, midlevel, and senior managers, comprising a full career track in the organization. Findings support the ""plex"" element of the model through the emergence of four leadership skill requirement categories. Findings also support the ""strata"" portion of the model in that different categories of leadership skill requirements emerge at different organizational levels, and that jobs at higher levels of the organization require higher levels of all leadership skills. In addition, although certain Cognitive skill requirements are important across organizational levels, certain Strategic skill requirements only fully emerge at the highest levels in the organization.

427,Warner N.,Screening leadership through Shakespeare: Paradoxes of leader-follower relations in Henry V on film,Leadership Quarterly,2007,"This paper focuses on the depiction of leadership in Kenneth Branagh's cinematic interpretation of Shakespeare's history play, Henry V, with substantial comparative discussion of the earlier version directed by Laurence Olivier-an important and justly celebrated film, but one that lacks the Branagh film's nuanced, detailed emphasis on leader-follower relations. Blending analysis of performance and film technique with the insights of leadership research in the social sciences, this paper explores the film's treatment of transformational leadership, charisma, task vs. relationship approaches, and follower empowerment. The paper argues that in terms of leadership technique, King Henry exemplifies what contemporary theory generally associates with effective, inspiring leadership. In terms of leadership content, however-content understood here as the goals and consequences of leadership-Branagh's film seriously qualifies and darkens the moral dimensions of Henry's rule. Throughout the film, follower empowerment paradoxically operates as a form of follower control, serving chiefly to advance the king's own agenda of imperialism and power aggrandizement. Ultimately, Branagh's Henry V is a brilliantly realized artistic examination of how the most compelling, follower-enhancing leadership can become insidiously compromised by its own ethical myopia. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The current paper examines the relative impact of these leader behaviors with respect to two unexplored issues: the differences between the building and erosion of subordinates' trust in their leader, and the differences between situations in which the subordinate are highly vulnerable or less vulnerable as a result of the leader's actions. On the basis of content analysis of 988 critical incidents collected from 733 cadets in officers training courses, we compared the relative importance of the different leadership behaviors in trust-building versus trust-erosion incidents and in situations varying in their magnitude of followers' vulnerability. The findings show that behaviors reflecting leader ability and integrity were more salient in trust-erosion incidents and that behaviors reflecting leader benevolence were more salient in trust-building incidents. Greater subordinate vulnerability increased the importance of behaviors reflecting leader integrity or ability (depending on the nature of the vulnerability) compared to behaviors reflecting the leader's benevolence, and vulnerability increased the likelihood that trust would be eroded.

420,Uhl-Bien M.,Relational Leadership Theory: Exploring the social processes of leadership and organizing,Leadership Quarterly,2006,"Relational leadership is a relatively new term in the leadership literature, and because of this, its meaning is open to interpretation. In the present article I describe two perspectives of relational leadership: an entity perspective that focuses on identifying attributes of individuals as they engage in interpersonal relationships, and a relational perspective that views leadership as a process of social construction through which certain understandings of leadership come about and are given privileged ontology. These approaches can be complementary, but their implications for study and practice are quite different. After reviewing leadership research relative to these two perspectives I offer Relational Leadership Theory (RLT) as an overarching framework for the study of leadership as a social influence process through which emergent coordination (e.g., evolving social order) and change (e.g., new approaches, values, attitudes, behaviors, ideologies) are constructed and produced. This framework addresses relationships both as an outcome of investigation (e.g., How are leadership relationships produced?) and a context for action (e.g., How do relational dynamics contribute to structuring?). RLT draws from both entity and relational ontologies and methodologies to more fully explore the relational dynamics of leadership and organizing. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The inductively developed propositions capture the dynamic interplay of individual consciousness and external phenomena, and reveal processes apparently crucial to the construction of their higher purpose.

The typical approach to aggregate measure design in organization studies is to create measures based on individual-level metric structures, then evaluate whether the individual level measures can be aggregated. We propose that the field continue to use this approach for fundamentally individual-level constructs, but to also make greater use of two alternative approaches that are now only occasionally used. One approach used in cross-cultural research is to aggregate items to the target level, then evaluate measurement structure based on the relationships among items at the target level. Another approach is to aggregate individual-level scales to the target level, then evaluate measure characteristics based on the relationships among scales at the target level. We also recommend that constructing measures based on relationships among items or among scales at aggregate levels offers an approach to studying organizational culture that is distinct from organizational climate.

Participants, with more or less traditional gender attitudes (orientation), were members, under high or low group salience conditions (salience), of non-interactive laboratory groups that had ""instrumental"" or ""expressive"" group norms (norm), and a male or female leader (leader gender). As predicted, these four variables interacted significantly to affect perceptions of leadership effectiveness. Reconfiguration of the eight conditions formed by orientation, norm and leader gender produced a single prototypicality variable. Irrespective of participant gender, prototypical leaders were considered more effective in high then low salience groups, and in high salience groups prototypical leaders were more effective than less prototypical leaders.

A meta-analysis,Leadership Quarterly,2006,"Despite the increased work on leadership in teams, there is a lack of integration concerning the relationship between leader behaviors and team performance outcomes. A framework depicting the relationship between leadership functions, specific leadership behaviors, and conditions which enable team performance was created. Using this framework, a meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between leadership behavior in teams and behaviorally-based team performance outcomes. Results suggest the use of task-focused behaviors is moderately related to perceived team effectiveness and team productivity (.333, .203). Person-focused behaviors were related to perceived team effectiveness (.360), team productivity (.284), and team learning (.560). Sub-group analyses indicated that the specific leadership behaviors investigated were generally related to team performance outcomes. Most notably, empowerment behaviors accounted for nearly 30% of the variance in team learning. Finally, moderator analyses investigating the level of task interdependence were conducted.

We used sociometric data from 28 field-based sales teams to investigate how the network structure of leadership perceptions considered at the team level of analysis was related to team performance. We failed to find support for the idea that the more leadership is distributed across the members of a team the better the team's performance: Decentralization of the leadership network (across three different operationalizations of network decentralization) was not significantly related to superior team performance. But we did find support for the idea that certain kinds of decentralized leadership structures are associated with better team performance than others.

One recent approach suggests that leaders enhance team functioning by intervening in the context of specific events, where the effectiveness of active intervention strategies is moderated by event disruptiveness [Morgeson, F.P. (2005). The external leadership of self-managing teams: Intervening in the context of novel and disruptive events. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90 497-508.]. The present study extends this research by examining the relationship between event criticality, urgency, and duration and event disruptiveness as well as the amount of time leaders spend managing different types of events. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods in four different organizations, we found that these three characteristics of events were positively related to team disruption, but only urgency was related to the amount of time leaders spent managing the event. A qualitative analysis of the events revealed that the impact of events on team functioning and leader intervention varied according to the type of event encountered.

Vertical leadership stems from an appointed or formal leader of a team (e.g., the CEO), whereas shared leadership is a form of distributed leadership stemming from within a team. Transformational, transactional, empowering, and directive dimensions of both vertical and shared leadership were examined. New venture performance was considered in terms of revenue growth and employee growth. The first sample was comprised of 66 top management teams of firms drawn from Inc. Magazine's annual list of America's 500 fastest growing startups. The seconded sample consisted of 154 top management teams of startups randomly drawn from Dun and Bradstreet, which compiles the most extensive database available for identifying relatively young American-based ventures. Both vertical and shared leadership were found to be highly significant predictors of new venture performance. Further, hierarchical regression analysis found the shared leadership variables to account for a significant amount of variance in new venture performance beyond the vertical leadership variables. These results were consistent across both samples, thus providing robust evidence for the value of shared leadership, in addition to the more traditional concept of vertical leadership. © 2006.",Management; New venture; Shared leadership; Startups; Vertical leadership,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33744514580&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2006.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=60b1a15e3971df63bb68cf20f21704a9

Bedeian notes that leadership has been described as (a) synonymous with holding a supervisory or managerial position, (b) the possession of certain personal qualities, and (c) a category of behavior in which an individual acts in a certain manner, thereby influencing others to follow, and wonders if divergent findings regarding the relationship between leadership and other constructs may simply reflect differences in how leadership is defined. Hunt responds to Bedeian by providing a brief history of the literature's treatment of leadership/management differences and arguing for: (1) a framework that helps focus on the different historical-contextual aspects within which one would specifically be called upon to differentiate between leadership and management, and (2) the assumption that leadership is a subset of management, with both needing to be carried out (though not necessarily by the same person) to ensure organizational success.

Based on Affective Events Theory (AET), I argue that leaders are sources of employee positive and negative emotions at work. Certain leader behaviors displayed during interactions with their employees are the sources of these affective events. The second theoretical underpinning of the article is the Asymmetry Effect of emotion. Consistent with this theory, employees are more likely to recall negative incidents than positive incidents. In a qualitative study, evidence that these processes exist in the workplace was found. Leader behaviors were sources of positive or negative emotional responses in employees; employees recalled more negative incidents than positive incidents, and they recalled them more intensely and in more detail than positive incidents. Consequently, leaders may need to exercise their emotional intelligence to generate emotional uplifts to overcome the hassles in the workplace that employees seem to remember so vividly. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This article proposes a theoretical model to identify conditions under which charismatic leadership and values inadvertently give rise to employee disenchantment, despite the good intentions of leaders and followers. The model integrates findings from a qualitative longitudinal study of a small advertising firm with prior research to develop new theory on unintended negative consequences of charismatic leadership. We propose that employee sensemaking triggered by strong organizational values can increase the risk of attributions of leader hypocrisy, which lead to employee disenchantment in a process we call the hypocrisy attribution dynamic. Value expansion, organizational tenure, and perceived benefit/harm are proposed to moderate the hypocrisy attribution dynamic, influencing the chances of negative sensemaking about leaders' behavior. This research sheds light on mechanisms through which charismatic leadership and values achieve their effects, and suggests that value expansion may be a double-edged sword - heightening followers' experience of meaning at work but also increasing the risk of subsequent disenchantment. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The study illuminates the spiritual generativity of ego-transcendental processes underlying the transformation of challenges into opportunities by these leaders in responding exceptionally to challenging circumstances. The method adapts procedures of transcendental phenomenology, phenomenography and other qualitative approaches. Based on an in-depth analysis of 504 events from the autobiographies of the ten leaders, the paper integrates the uniformities underlying the particularistic aspects of exceptional responses resulting from a vertical, within-autobiography analysis. The uniformities underlying the universalistic aspects of exceptional responses, in turn, result from a horizontal, across-autobiographies analysis.

This definition, based on three fundamental spiritual needs, has implications for how leaders can enhance work unit performance by nurturing the spirit at work. In an exploratory study of six work units in a large hospital system we used an instrument that measures workplace spirituality. The results led to propositions concerning the effect of work unit spirituality on work unit performance and the relationship between work unit spirituality and leadership. Among medical units within the same hospital system, work unit spirituality is greater in some than in others; work unit performance is associated with work unit spirituality; and work unit leaders likely have an impact on the degree to which work units acknowledge and encourage issues of the spirit. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Spiritual leadership comprises the values, attitudes, and behaviors required to intrinsically motivate one's self and others in order to have a sense of spiritual survival through calling and membership - i.e., they experience meaning in their lives, have a sense of making a difference, and feel understood and appreciated. The effect of spiritual leadership in establishing this sense of leader and follower spiritual survival is to create value congruence across the strategic, empowered team, and individual levels to, ultimately, foster higher levels of organizational commitment, productivity, and employee well-being. The primary purpose of this research is to test the SLT causal model that hypothesizes positive relationships among the qualities of spiritual leadership, spiritual survival, and organizational productivity and commitment using longitudinal data from a newly formed Apache Longbow helicopter attack squadron at Ft. Hood, Texas. The results provide strong initial support for SLT and its measures. A methodology was developed for establishing a baseline for future organizational development interventions as well as an action agenda for future research on spiritual leadership in general and Army training and development in particular. We conclude that spiritual leadership theory offers promise as a springboard for a new paradigm for leadership theory, research, and practice given that it (1) incorporates and extends transformational and charismatic theories as well as ethics- and values-based theories (e.g., authentic and servant leadership) and (2) avoids the pitfalls of measurement model misspecification. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The model draws upon social identity theory to hypothesize that this procedural justice influence is linked to the identity relevance of procedural justice information. As a consequence, it is hypothesized that those who are more strongly identified with their company will be more influenced by procedural justice information. This hypothesis is tested in a merger situation in which leaders are seeking employee acceptance for a change in corporate structure in a situation in which their company is ""taken over"" by another. The study examines whether the fairness of the procedures managers use to implement the merger shapes employee's subsequent reactions to the new company and whether this influence is stronger when identification is high as predicted by social identity theory. The results suggest that if leaders act in procedurally fair ways, they are viewed as more legitimate and more competent, and employees are more accepting of organizational change. This influence is stronger among those who identify more highly with the organization. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

There has been considerable interest in this new area of study. Scholars conducting work on authentic leadership believe that the recent upswing in corporate scandals and management malfeasance indicate that a new perspective on leadership is necessary. In order to address these negative societal trends, proponents of authentic leadership take a very normative approach, placing a strong emphasis on the creation of interventions to facilitate the development of authenticity. We concur with the basic tenets of this initiative. However, in this article, we note that it is premature to focus on designing interventions to develop authentic leaders before taking further steps in defining, measuring, and rigorously researching this construct.

Drawing from hermeneutic philosophy, I offer a different perspective on authenticity in leadership that is based on the framework of the narrative self. This framework suggests that authenticity is not achieved by self-awareness of one's inner values or purpose, but instead is emergent from the narrative process in which others play a constitutive role in the self.

Achieving relational authenticity requires that followers accord leaders the legitimacy to promote a set of values on behalf of a community. Only under such conditions can leaders elicit the personal and social identification of followers that can enhance the success of a group, organization, or society. This article presents evidence that obtaining this identification is more challenging for female than male leaders and more generally for members of outsider groups that have traditionally not had access to particular leadership roles. The training of women and outsiders for leadership should focus on these relational aspects of achieving authenticity as a leader. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A life-stories approach to authentic leadership development",Leadership Quarterly,2005,"In this paper, we first develop the concepts of authentic leaders, authentic leadership, and authentic leader development. We suggest a definition of authentic leaders, which is based on the leader's self-concept: His or her self-knowledge, self-concept clarity, self-concordance, and person-role merger, and on the extent to which the leader's self-concept is expressed in his or her behavior. Following, we offer a life-story approach to the development of authentic leaders. We argue that authentic leadership rests heavily on the self-relevant meanings the leader attaches to his or her life experiences, and these meanings are captured in the leader's life-story. We suggest that self-knowledge, self-concept clarity, and person-role merger are derived from the life-story. Therefore, the construction of a life-story is a major element in the development of authentic leaders. We further argue that the life-story provides followers with a major source of information on which to base their judgments about the leader's authenticity.

Based on a priori theory and empirical work, we examined the influence of affect on the measurement of transformational leadership, as assessed by the MLQ, and its structural relationships with important organizational outcomes in two separate studies. Results of the first study (N=307) indicated that while temporary mood states have little impact either on measurement or structural relationships, target-specific affect (i.e., liking) influenced both. The effect of target-specific affect was fully replicated in a second study (N=120) using an independent sample and a more conservative estimate of the liking effect. Overall, the results of this research suggest that transformational leadership, at least when assessed with the MLQ, is highly influenced by the interpersonal affect raters feel towards the target being rated (i.e., liking).

Following these propositions, we look in detail at seven succession case studies taken from the automobile distribution industry. These cases differ in terms of the success of the results. The quality of interpersonal relationships, successors' expectations, and the role of the predecessor appear to be critical in distinguishing between more and less successful processes. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study is to analyze known academic articles for how they characterize workplace spirituality, explore the nexus between spirituality and leadership, and discover essential factors and conditions for promoting a theory of spiritual leadership within the context of the workplace. An emergent process was used to identify and validate eight areas of difference and/or distinction in the workplace spirituality literature: 1.) definition, 2.) connected to religion, 3.) marked by epiphany, 4.) teachable, 5.) individual development, 6.) measurable, 7.) profitable/ productive, and 8.) nature of the phenomenon. Eighty-seven scholarly articles were coded for each of these areas.

At each skill level, the emphasis is on qualitatively different knowledge and information processing capabilities. In addition, because leadership skill development requires proaction on the part of the leader, we propose that identity, meta-cognitive processes, and emotional regulation are critical factors in developing the deeper cognitive structures associated with leadership expertise.

The analysis also focuses (a) on the way in which leaders' identity projects are constrained by social reality, and (b) on the manner in which effective leadership contributes to the transformation of this reality through the initiation of structure that mobilizes and redirects a group's identity-based social power. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This review shows that while qualitative research has made some important contributions to certain areas of leadership, such as the role of leaders in the change process, it is sometimes not as distinctive, when compared to quantitative research, as might be supposed. The piece also examines studies that combine quantitative with qualitative research. The different ways in which the two approaches are combined is a particular emphasis in this examination. In addition, the article explores the issue of whether the corpus of research that has been accumulated by qualitative researchers can be combined with that of quantitative researchers. A central ingredient of the discussion of qualitative research is the tendency for many researchers not to build sufficiently on the studies of leadership conducted by others. It is argued that giving greater attention to this issue will allow the contributions of qualitative research on leadership to become clearer. © Elsevier Ltd.

Despite these challenges, leadership is currently considered a ""mature field"" [Hunt, J.G., & Dodge, G.E. (2000). Leader Deja Vu all over again. The Leadership Quarterly, 11 (4), 453-458] even though this maturity has not been achieved without considerable growing pains. Similar to the path that leadership scholars have taken, those who study entrepreneurship also struggle with issues associated with a field in its early stages. This review examines the intersection between the fields of leadership and entrepreneurship with an emphasis on how the path taken by leadership research can inform entrepreneurship and possibly lessen this young field's growing pains. We first identify several areas where these fields theoretically converge (both in the models employed and the research questions addressed). Next, we take a historical perspective of leadership and entrepreneurship by identifying the life cycle stage of each construct or domain. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts on how the entrepreneurship field may avoid (or is avoiding) the pitfalls experienced by those who study leadership. © Elsevier Ltd.

Results were consistent with expectations that negative leader affect displayed during feedback would produce lower perceptions of leader effectiveness and lower quality performance on a group task than positive leader affect. Also in line with expectations was the finding that leader affect interacted with goal type such that groups with a prevention goal perceived the negative affect leader more favorably than groups with a promotion goal. Goals also interacted with feedback focus.

It argues that although these models emphasize leadership as a social process dependent on social networks of influence, the concepts are often presented as gender and, to a lesser degree, power neutral, not only in theory, but in practice. The essay explores this phenomenon, arguing that the concepts are not gender, power, or sex neutral but instead are rooted in a set of social interactions in which - doing gender, ""doing power,"" and ""doing leadership"" are linked. It explores these dynamics and suggests that theories of leadership that fail to consider the gender/power implications of social interactions and networks of influence may lead to the cooptation of these models, resulting in their being brought into the mainstream discourse in a way that silences their radical challenge to current work practices, structures, and norms. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

513,"Beu D.S., Buckley M.R.",This is war: How the politically astute achieve crimes of obedience through the use of moral disengagement,Leadership Quarterly,2004,"Generally, corporate scandals occur because of the actions of a number of people. We propose that transactional, personalized charismatic leaders who are politically astute may create an environment where their subordinates commit crimes of obedience. According to social cognitive theory, individuals behave immorally by disengaging their self-regulatory mechanisms [ Org. Behav. Hum. Decis. Process 50 (1991a) 248; Bandura, A. (1991b). Social cognitive theory of moral thought and action. In W.M. Kurtines and J.L. Gerwitz, (Eds.), Handbook of moral behavior and development (vol. 1, pp. 45-103). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum]. Leaders can cognitively reconstrue the conduct to convince the subordinates that the behavior is morally justified. The employees can disclaim their agentive role in the consequences of the action and leaders can use their authority, power, status, and social influence to convince employees that they have no choice in their behavior. The organizational structure may allow employees to ""just do their jobs"" without consideration of the consequences. Finally, leaders can frame behavior in such a way that others believe there really are no negative consequences, and thus, no victims. We conclude with some recommendations on how to run an organization effectively, yet with moral issues activated. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

511,"Kan M.M., Parry K.W.",Identifying paradox: A grounded theory of leadership in overcoming resistance to change,Leadership Quarterly,2004,"The full grounded theory method was used in the present study to investigate nursing leadership in a New Zealand hospital setting. One finding that emerged clearly from the research was the important role played by organizational politics in both facilitating the process of leadership and in confounding it. Data were collected over a two-year period. The range of data sources included nonparticipant observation, informal/unstructured and formal/semistructured interviews, document analysis, and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). Data triangulation within the grounded theory method is a major contribution of this study. Nurse leaders displayed high levels of transformational leadership according to the questionnaire data. However, qualitative analysis of the data suggested that other factors were working to prevent nurse leaders from maximizing organizational change outcomes. Two near-core categories partially explained why transformational nurse leaders were not realizing their leadership potential. One near-core category was the process of repressing leadership, the other was multiple realities. The highest level of abstraction of the data led to the emergence of the substantive basic social process of identifying paradox. Identifying paradox was conceptually very close to the definition of politics in organizational leadership which is the ""constructive management of shared meaning."" This core category explained the social process by which the staff either legitimize or reconcile paradoxical understandings created from the multiple realities of the three subcultures working in the hospital setting. If paradoxes are identified and reconciled, and multiple realities converge, organizational change efforts are more likely to be accepted by the staff because the change is in line with their reality. Conversely, if paradoxes are not identified and/or legitimized, multiple realities diverge and organizational change efforts are less likely to be accepted by the staff. Findings are interpreted from the political perspective. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Guided by Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action [ Psychological Bulletin 84 (1977) 888], we investigated two potentially relevant antecedents to performing TLB: cynicism about organizational change (CAOC) and the leader's social context-specifically peer leadership behavior. We hypothesized that CAOC would negatively predict TLB, while peer leadership behavior would positively predict TLB. Further, we expected that peer leadership behavior would have a positive moderating effect on leader CAOC. Data were gathered from 227 managers from multiple organizations and their 2247 subordinates. Findings supported the proposed hypotheses.

The study first established that leader support, proposed to be a key feature of the work environment for creativity, was positively related to the peer-rated creativity of subordinates working on creative projects in seven different companies. Then, to identify the specific leader behaviors that might give rise to perceived support, two qualitative analyses were conducted on daily diary narratives written by these subordinates. The first, which focused on specific leader behaviors that had significantly predicted leader support in a preliminary quantitative analysis, illuminated both effective and ineffective forms of leader behavior.

321,Krause D.E.,Influence-based leadership as a determinant of the inclination to innovate and of innovation-related behaviors. An empirical investigation,Leadership Quarterly,2004,"The Lazarus theory, which has been adapted to the context of innovation, is used as a basis for developing a model to explain how leadership affects cognitive processes of perceiving the work setting (need for and susceptibility to change), innovative behaviors (generation and testing of ideas, and implementation), and innovation-blocking behaviors (intrapsychic coping and flight). Leadership is described in terms of selected bases of influence (identification, expert knowledge/information, granting freedom and autonomy, support for innovation, and openness of the decision-making process). The model's explanatory power is tested on a sample of 399 middle managers from different German organizations of various sizes and sectors. Hierarchical regression analyses show that granting freedom and autonomy and using expert knowledge and information have the most positive effect on these cognitive processes and innovative behaviors, and the most negative effect on innovation-blocking behaviors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

518,"Hall A.T., Blass F.R., Ferris G.R., Massengale R.",Leader reputation and accountability in organizations: Implications for dysfunctional leader behavior,Leadership Quarterly,2004,"We argue that leader accountability is more of an informal, sociopolitical process, than it is a formal one, and a central component of this informal accountability is leader reputation. We propose that leaders' reputations (which includes human and social capital, political skill and style, etc.) influence how much stakeholders trust them. This, in turn, affects the extent to which formal accountability mechanisms are imposed upon leaders. In this paper, we concentrate on the potential for dysfunctional leader behavior. However, how stakeholders interpret actual leader behavior, whether functional or dysfunctional, is moderated by the motives or intentions that those stakeholders attribute to the behavior. The result is a perception of leader performance and effectiveness that redefines or reinforces leader reputation, and also serves to modify or reinforce leader style. Therefore, a sociopolitical perspective of accountability and reputation asserts that the risk of a diminished reputation is a form of accountability that is effective to the extent that attributions of leader intentions are accurate. Implications for this conceptualization are discussed, as are directions for future research. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

While some researchers have begun to shun the notion that politics should be viewed as necessarily bad and undesirable, it is still commonly seen as a negative attribute of the organizational environment. Moreover, organizational members who perceive themselves to be working in negative political environments may develop cynical attitudes toward the organization. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the role that attributions play in eliciting negative cognitive and affective reactions to the political environment. We argue that because the quality of the leader-member exchange (LMX) is often central to these reactions, LMX theory and research possess considerable promise for enhancing our understanding of these processes. We explore attributional processes in detail, with special attention to (a) how these attributional processes occur within a leader-member relationship and (b) how attributions ultimately impact perceptions of politics, as well as organizational cynicism. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Solving problems creatively requires extensive and effortful cognitive processing. This requirement is magnified further by the complex, ambiguous situations in which most organizational problems occur. Employees must define and construct a problem, search and retrieve problem-relevant information, and generate and evaluate a diverse set of alternative solutions. Creativity necessitates that all these activities are completed effectively. It is unlikely, therefore, that creative outcomes will be realized without a large degree of support from organizations and organizational leaders. To provide this support, leaders must understand the cognitive requirements of creative problem solving.

The sample comprised 3447 respondents from 98 primary health care teams (PHCTs), 113 community mental health teams (CMHTs), and 72 breast cancer care teams (BCTs). The results revealed that leadership clarity is associated with clear team objectives, high levels of participation, commitment to excellence, and support for innovation. Team processes consistently predicted team innovation across all three samples. Team leadership predicted innovation in the latter two samples, and there was some evidence that team processes partly mediated this relationship. The results imply the need for theory that incorporates clarity and not just style of leadership.

A multisource approach is used to collect survey data from 32 Taiwanese companies in the electronics/telecommunications industry. The findings support a direct and positive link between a style of leadership that has been labeled as ""transformational"" and organizational innovation.

Evidence for social loafing was observed, i.e., anonymity led to lower participation and cooperation in the group rewards condition relative to the individual rewards condition. Further analysis revealed that social loafing was confined to the transactional leadership condition. Corresponding to the social loafing effect, anonymity led to lower group efficacy and satisfaction with the task and higher originality of solutions in the group rewards condition relative to the individual rewards condition. Transactional leadership was associated with greater group efficacy and solution originality than transformational leadership.

We hypothesized that evaluations of leadership-and hence the psychometric properties of leadership instruments-may be affected by the context in which leadership is observed and evaluated. Using largely homogenous business samples consisting of 2279 pooled male and 1089 pooled female raters who evaluated same-gender leaders, we found support for the nine-factor leadership model proposed by Bass and Avolio. The model was configurally and partially metrically invariant-suggesting that the same constructs were validly measured in the male and female groups. Mean differences were found between the male and female samples on four leadership factors (Study 1). Next, using factor-level data of 18 independently gathered samples (N = 6525 raters) clustered into prototypically homogenous contexts, we tested the nine-factor model and found it was stable (i.e., fully invariant) within homogenous contexts (Study 2). The contextual factors comprised environmental risk, leader-follower gender, and leader hierarchical level. Implications for use of the MLQ and nine-factor model are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The meaning that middle and senior managers ascribe to leadership is explored.

We raise strong doubts about leadership as a construct saying something valuable and valid about what managers do in this kind of setting.

233,"Edmondson A.C., Roberto M.A., Watkins M.D.",A dynamic model of top management team effectiveness: Managing unstructured task streams,Leadership Quarterly,2003,"Leadership research relating top management team (TMT) demographics to firm performance has produced mixed empirical results. This article suggests a new explanation for these inconsistencies. We first note that a given TMT is likely to face a variety of different situations over time. Thus, while TMT demographic composition is relatively stable, the TMT task is dynamic and variable. In some situations, team members have similar information and interests (a symmetric distribution); in others, information or interests diverge (an asymmetric distribution). Based on team effectiveness theory, we argue that, unless group process is managed accordingly, asymmetric distributions of situation-specific information and interests will reduce TMT decision-making effectiveness. We then develop leader process choices to mitigate the potentially harmful effect of these asymmetries. These arguments form the basis of a theoretical model of TMT effectiveness that integrates insights from research on leadership, TMTs, small group process, and negotiation, and has practical implications for how leaders of senior teams can improve team effectiveness through appropriate process choices. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study applied a method for identifying and assessing TK to the domain of military leadership in order to understand why some leaders are more successful than others. Interviews were conducted with Army officers at three levels of leadership in order to identify the type of practical, experience-based knowledge that is not necessarily part of formal training or doctrine. Subsequently, the Tacit Knowledge for Military Leaders (TKML) inventory, consisting of a series of leadership scenarios, was developed to assess the amount of knowledge leaders possess. Three versions of the TKML were administered to a total of 562 leaders at the platoon, company, and battalion levels. At all three levels, TKML scores correlated with ratings of leadership effectiveness from either peers or superiors, and the scores explained variance in leadership effectiveness beyond a test of general verbal ability and a test of TK for managers. These results indicate that domain-specific TK can explain individual differences in leadership effectiveness and suggest that leadership development initiatives should include efforts to facilitate the acquisition of TK. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Q. 10 (1999) 181] distinguish between authentic transformational leadership and inauthentic or pseudo-transformational leadership. The present article analyzes the conception of authenticity at the core of this normative account of leadership. I argue that the distinction between authentic transformational leadership and pseudo-transformational leadership fails to ground a sufficient response to ethical concerns about transformational leadership. To the extent that this theory holds that altruism suffices for ethical success, it misses the fact that leaders sometimes behave immorally precisely because they are blinded by their own values. In the end, we can expect that this kind of blindness will come to bear importantly on the moral psychology of leadership and, in some cases, encourage transformational leaders to believe that they are justified in making exceptions of themselves on the grounds that their leadership behavior is authentic. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Pessimistic conclusions from these studies regarding situational modifiers challenge the foundations of path-goal and substitutes for leadership theories. However, analysis of this research reveals questionable methodological practices that cast doubt on the validity of these conclusions. This article discusses two methodological issues, elucidates specific flaws in methods used in recent leadership studies, and makes recommendations for the use of moderated multiple regression (MMR) in leadership studies. We argue that low power to detect moderators and inappropriate use of regression methods can account for the lack of confirmatory findings regarding moderators. Comparative analysis using a previously published data set provides strong support for major arguments presented in this article.

First, three major domains in which developmental outcomes have been mostly discussed, namely motivation, empowerment, and morality, are highlighted, expanded, and discussed. Next the analogy between transformational leaders and ""good parents"" is employed to explore the underlying developmental processes. Specifically, conceptualizations, notions, and findings are borrowed from the vast literature on parenting to help us understand these processes. Several major arguments and propositions, which can be tested empirically, are formulated by means of this analogy. These propositions and their conceptualization can broaden our perspective about the processes that underlie many of the outcome variables so frequently investigated and discussed in the leadership literature, and offer a major opportunity to probe the currently less explored developmental and dynamic aspects of leadership. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Laboring at perhaps the most inspiring and difficult of human endeavors, a creator frequently experiences the excitement of discovery and the anguish of failure. Engaging in creativity in organizations inevitably creates tension, conflict, and emotionally charged debates and disagreements because complex organizations need both control and predictability and creativity and change. In this paper, we describe five routes through which the innate creativity of organizational members can be awakened: identification, information gathering, idea generation, idea evaluation and modification, and idea implementation. We propose that leaders, and in particular, the emotional intelligence of leaders, plays a critical role in enabling and supporting the awakening of creativity through these five complementary routes. After describing theory and research on emotional intelligence, we develop propositions concerning how leaders' emotional intelligence can enable and promote followers' creativity in multiple ways. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

283,Fry L.W.,Toward a theory of spiritual leadership,Leadership Quarterly,2003,"A causal theory of spiritual leadership is developed within an intrinsic motivation model that incorporates vision, hope/faith, and altruistic love, theories of workplace spirituality, and spiritual survival. The purpose of spiritual leadership is to create vision and value congruence across the strategic, empowered team, and individual levels and, ultimately, to foster higher levels of organizational commitment and productivity.I first examine leadership as motivation to change and review motivation-based leadership theories. Second, I note the accelerating call for spirituality in the workplace, describe the universal human need for spiritual survival through calling and membership, and distinguish between religion and spirituality. Next, I introduce a generic definition of God as a higher power with a continuum upon which humanistic, theistic, and pantheistic definitions of God can be placed. I also review religious- and ethics-and-values-based leadership theories and conclude that, to motivate followers, leaders must get in touch with their core values and communicate them to followers through vision and personal actions to create a sense of spiritual survival through calling and membership.I then argue that spiritual leadership theory is not only inclusive of other major extant motivation-based theories of leadership, but that it is also more conceptually distinct, parsimonious, and less conceptually confounded. And, by incorporating calling and membership as two key follower needs for spiritual survival, spiritual leadership theory is inclusive of the religious- and ethics and values-based approaches to leadership.

Our starting point for this update is roughly 1996-1997, since those are the dates of two important reviews of the cross-cultural leadership literature [specifically, House, Wright, and Aditya (House, R. J., Wright, N. S., & Aditya, R. N. (1997). Cross-cultural research on organizational leadership: A critical analysis and a proposed theory. In: P. C. Earley, & M. Erez (Eds.), New perspectives on international industrial/organizational psychology (pp. 535-625). San Francisco, CA) and Dorfman (Dorfman, P. W. (1996). International and cross-cultural leadership research. In: B. J. Punnett, & O. Shenkar (Eds.), Handbook for international management research , pp. 267-349, Oxford, UK: Blackwell)]. We describe the beginnings of the decline in the quest for universal leadership principles that apply equivalently across all cultures, and we focus on the increasing application of the dimensions of culture identified by Hofstede [Hofstede, G. (1980). Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values (Abridged ed.). Newbury Park, CA: Sage] and others to describe variation in leadership styles, practices, and preferences. We also note the emergence of the field of cross-cultural leadership as a legitimate and independent field of endeavor, as reflected in the emergence of publication outlets for this research, and the establishment of long-term multinational multi-investigator research programs on the topic. We conclude with a discussion of progress made since the two pieces that were our departure point, and of progress yet to be made. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.",Cross-cultural; Globe; Leadership; Multi-national; Universal,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0344118799&doi=10.1016%2fj.leaqua.2003.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=601b409d529e1dbdb7e91dbff9a8c4c3
218,Vecchio R.P.,Leadership and gender advantage,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"Claims of ""gender advantage"" in the area of leadership are critiqued, and the findings from research on sex/gender differences in social behavior and leader effectiveness are reviewed. Meta-analytic studies that have considered sex differences in leadership are examined with respect to both leader behavior and leader effectiveness. It is concluded that claims of comparative gender advantage, based on stereotypic reasoning, are overstated. Recent research on gender similarity is highlighted with recognition that a ""fine-grained"" analytic approach is critical. Plus, the usefulness of including temporal dimensions and perceived leader tolerance of demographic differences is suggested. Additional attention is given to research indicating that gender stereotypic descriptive tendencies arise when men and women are asked to describe behaviors for imaginary others or to describe their own actions after the passage of time. Literature that pertains to whether females and males differ in effectiveness as followers is also reviewed. Finally, an agenda is outlined for future gender research on aspects of leadership and followership. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Although many variables influence creativity and innovation in organizational settings, there is reason to suspect that leaders and their behavior represent a particularly powerful influence. In the present article, we review the available literature examining leadership behaviors contributing to creativity and innovation in organizational settings. Based on the findings obtained in these studies, we argue that the leadership of creative people requires expertise. Moreover, the successful leader must employ a number of direct and indirect influence tactics-tactics consistent with the needs of creative people working in an organizational environment.

We review available literature and demonstrate that integral to untangling the dynamics of the leadership influencing process is an understanding of leader-follower distance. We present distance in terms of three independent dimensions: leader-follower physical distance, perceived social distance, and perceived task interaction frequency. We discuss possible antecedents of leader-follower distance, including organizational and task characteristics, national culture, and leader/follower implicit motives. Finally, we use configural theory to present eight typologies (i.e., coexistence of a cluster or constellation of independent factors serving as a unit of analysis) of leader distance and propose an integrated cross-level model of leader distance, linking the distance typologies to leader outcomes at the individual and group levels of analysis. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

214,"Osborn R.N., Hunt J.G., Jauch L.R.",Toward a contextual theory of leadership,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"We propose moving leadership theory and research to another level-one that recognizes that current leadership scholarship is not invalid but incomplete. Such scholarship needs to be looked at in different ways and with various approaches relevant for different circumstances. Macro views need increasing recognition, but to supplement rather than replace currently emphasized meso/micro perspectives. Also, human agency is not to be replaced with mechanistic prescription, but leadership scholars are in a position to contribute to the strategy and organization theory research that currently minimizes leader influence. This philosophy is illustrated through the interplay of leadership with the four contexts of: stability, crisis, dynamic equilibrium, and edge of chaos; the latter operationalized through a complexity theory/dynamic systems perspective. We discuss each context and leadership, in terms of patterning of attention and network leadership, and conclude with a brief measurement treatment. These contexts encourage researchers to reconsider temporality, causal relations, units of analysis, and dependent variables consistent with the social construction of human agency within the given context, to develop more robust models and leadership understanding. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Conspicuous in its absence has been a conceptualization of leadership from a political perspective, despite appeals for such a theory and the widely acknowledged view of political processes in organizations. In this article, we develop a model of a political theory of leadership in an effort to address this need, and to demonstrate the versatility of such a conceptualization for understanding both leadership and social influence processes in organizations. Because we define politics in organizational leadership as the constructive management of shared meaning, we demonstrate how a political perspective does not necessarily cast leaders in a personally ambitious, manipulative role. We proceed to show how this political perspective can contribute to effectiveness through both enhanced leader outcomes and the constituencies' consequences to which leaders are directing their efforts. The implications for a political theory of leadership are discussed, as are directions for future research. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036888888&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2802%2900157-1&partnerID=40&md5=f7a3f5285cceea5ead184b81acfc5773

The findings show that transformational leadership has a significant direct influence on frustration and optimism, with the negative influence of frustration having a stronger effect on performance than the positive influence of optimism. Frustration and optimism are found to have a direct influence on performance, and the emotions, frustration and optimism, fully mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and performance. Thus, the effect of transformational leadership style on performance is significant, but indirect. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

211,Pescosolido A.T.,Emergent leaders as managers of group emotion,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"This article proposes a new role for emergent group leaders, that of the manager of group emotions. This description of leadership suggests that individual group members take leadership by providing certainty and direction during times of ambiguity. They are able to assume a leadership role by making an interpretation of the emotional response that best serves the group's needs, and then modeling that response. By modeling a particular emotional response, the leader resolves ambiguity and catalyzes the group to act. Simultaneously, they are able to increase group solidarity by creating shared emotion within the group and communal action. The idea of leadership as group emotional management is not tied to one specific individual, but rather, allows leadership to be enacted by different group members at different times. Leader emergence and leader success would be subject to several conditions, such as the emergent leader's degree of empathy, group norms of emotional expression, and ambiguous feedback regarding the group's performance. Qualitative analysis of group observation reveals several examples of group emotional management that are used to develop the concept. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The model is predicated on two central ideas. The first is that leadership is intrinsically an emotional process, where leaders display emotion and attempt to evoke emotion in their members. The second is that leadership is a process of social interaction and is therefore appropriately defined in terms of social, psychological theories such as the attribution theory. Our focus is on the perspective of members, not the leaders. Specifically, members' attributions about their leader's intentions influence how the members evaluate, interpret, and eventually label the leader's influence attempts as either ""true"" or ""pseudo"" transformational leadership. These attributions are determined by and themselves influence the members' emotions. We describe each of the elements of the model and conclude with a discussion of the implications of the model for theory, research, and practice. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

207,Humphrey R.H.,The many faces of emotional leadership,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"This article focuses heavily on overviewing and analyzing the seven articles in this special issue on emotions and leadership. The articles are discussed in terms of four key leadership issues. The first issue concerns the traits necessary for leadership. Empathy is shown to be an important variable that is central to both emotional intelligence and leadership emergence. The second issue concerns the relationship of emotions to the leadership process. It is argued that a key leadership function is to manage the emotions of group members, especially with regard to feelings related to frustration and optimism. The third issue involves our perceptions about leaders. Leaders' emotional displays are demonstrated to have a larger impact on perceptions of leaders than the content of the leaders' messages, at least in some circumstances. The fourth area involves the relationship between leadership and performance. Leaders' influences upon emotional process variables are found to have a large impact on performance. The article develops several propositions that summarize the content of this special issue and, in addition, develops new propositions that suggest future areas of research.

This article develops a model proposing two distinct behavioral routes that influence perception of an individual as a leader in a small group.

Applications of random coefficient modeling to leadership research,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"Understanding how leaders develop, adapt, and perform over time is central to many theories of leadership. However, for a variety of conceptual and methodological reasons, such longitudinal research remains uncommon in the leadership domain. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the leadership scholar to conceptual issues involved in longitudinal design and analysis, and then demonstrate the application of random coefficient modeling (RCM) as a framework capable of modeling longitudinal leadership data. The RCM framework is an extension of the traditional regression model, so many readers will already have the fundamental knowledge required to use RCM. However, RCM has the additional capability of analyzing the kinds of data commonly found in longitudinal studies, including correlated observations, missing data, and heterogeneity over time. Further, the RCM allows for testing predictors of change over time. Thus, we introduce conceptual issues related to longitudinal research, discuss RCM within the context of regression, and conclude with an application of the RCM approach.

As an alternative to the current focus, which is primarily on the deeds of individual leaders, the article proposes distributed leadership. The article shows how conventional constructs of leadership have difficulty accommodating changes in the division of labor in the workplace, especially, new patterns of interdependence and coordination which have given rise to distributed practice. A number of forms of distributed leadership are then outlined, in particular, three varieties of concertive action in which a key defining criterion is conjoint agency. These forms provide the basis for a taxonomy of distributed leadership and a review of examples in the literature.

Charismatic versus ideological leadership,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"Although numerous studies have examined the influence of vision on outstanding leadership, relatively little is known about how leaders create, or construct, a meaningful vision. Recently, however, a theory of vision formation has been proposed, which holds that visions arise from prescriptive mental models formulated by leaders following reflection on key causes and goals. One implication of this theory is that different styles of vision-based outstanding leadership will emerge depending on whether these prescriptive models stress personal values and standards (ideological leaders) or social needs and change requirements (charismatic leaders). To test this proposition, biographies of 60 notable historic leaders, both personalized and socialized leaders, were obtained and content coded with respect to ideological and charismatic behaviors as well as historic outcomes. In a series of multivariate analyses, support was obtained for the ideological and charismatic distinction.

A survey of 1137 employees across three organizations provided results that partially confirmed the predictions. Specifically, employees with higher levels of education and greater levels of job tenure expressed less preference for leader structuring, while females (relative to males) expressed greater preference for leader considerateness.

194,Hicks D.A.,Spiritual and religious diversity in the workplace. Implications for leadership,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"This article offers a critical analysis of scholarship on spirituality and leadership. The article argues that the concept of spirituality is more disparate and contested than the current leadership literature acknowledges. It asserts that spirituality is often defined in opposition to religion and that this opposition is not an accurate description of a complex interrelationship. Scholars who uphold a view of bringing the ""whole person"" to work are inconsistent if they view spirituality as appropriate in the workplace but exclude diverse employees' particular, specific religious expressions from it. The concluding section offers implications from this critical exploration of leadership and spirituality and suggests that the task of effective organizational leadership is not to promote a single spiritual framework but, rather, to create a structure and culture in which leaders and followers can respectfully negotiate religious and spiritual diversity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Manage. Rev. 23 (1998) 32.] self-presentational theory of charismatic leadership. We collected multisource field data in an information technology (IT) consulting firm and examined linkages among managers' self-system attributes (i.e., desired charismatic identity, self-monitoring), pro-social and self-serving impression management of managers, charismatic leadership of managers, and two measures of performance. Eighty-three managers provided self-reports of self-system attributes. Six months later, 249 subordinates rated the focal managers' impression management and charismatic leadership styles. Superiors of the focal managers provided performance ratings 7 months after collecting the subordinate ratings. Results indicated that complexity of desired charismatic identity was positively related to self-monitoring. Self-monitoring was negatively related to ratings of pro-social impression management and positively related to ratings of self-serving impression management. Pro-social impression management related positively to charismatic leadership, which predicted managerial and unit performance. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Our findings show a clear relationship of local leadership with the financial performance and organizational climate in the stores. The findings also show that the leadership styles have differential effects. Charismatic leadership and consideration have a substantial effect on climate and financial performance in the small stores, suggesting the relevance of personal leadership of the store manager in these small stores. Initiating structure leadership had no effect on financial results or organizational climate, either in the small stores or in the large stores.

Applying Gross' emotion regulation model, we argue that the EI of leaders and followers should have positive effects on job performance and attitudes. We also propose that the emotional labor of the job moderates the EI-job outcome relationship. Our results show that the EI of followers affects job performance and job satisfaction, while the EI of leaders affects their satisfaction and extra-role behavior. For followers, the proposed interaction effects between EI and emotional labor on job performance, organizational commitment, and turnover intention are also supported. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Yearly Overview Leadership 11 (2000) 435.]. In their article, these authors argue that contemporary leadership researchers tend to neglect the historical-contextual antecedents of the field and as a result are developing many theories that reflect little more than a form of ""academic amnesia"" and ""leadership déjà vu"". The importance of Hunt and Dodge's argument is reinforced through the use here of a form of deconstruction to reveal a lacuna in the leadership literature-the insufficient coverage of power, particularly at what is termed a deep structure level. With the current context of organizational change in mind, this lacuna is shown to have problematic consequences for leadership theory in general. More specifically, the increasing use of dispersed leadership strategies is shown to be particularly problematic. The article proposes a new conceptual framework that begins to address these problems and in so doing provides ideas and challenges for future research in the field. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, empirical studies have coded vision statements in noncomparable ways. To measure the content of vision statements, the present study demonstrates the application of the motive coding methodology developed by McClelland and Winter. Using two independent samples of vision statements, we further demonstrate the applicability of this methodology by testing for expected relationships between vision statements and individual, unit, and organizational performance. Half of the expected relationships yielded significant results. Nevertheless, motive imagery measures yielded reliable scores, were feasible to apply, and provided relevant measures of vision statement content. This methodology has the potential to allow researchers to test charismatic/transformational leadership theory in new ways and to provide leaders with concrete guidance about the content of their vision statements.

Need for leadership was paired with three leadership factors and five outcome variables, generating 15 possible moderating effects. Five of these were significant.

The purpose of this paper is to illustrate traditional WABA techniques and extend their use in terms of ""boundary condition"" analysis using multiple relationship analysis (MRA) so as to compare and contrast their results with the other techniques highlighted in this issue. Given a loose interpretation of WABA I, the results indicate that entire companies reporting a positive leadership climate had low levels of psychological hostility. However, the relationship between task significance and psychological hostility appears conditional upon leadership climate. Under poor leadership conditions, the level of task significance in the unit as a whole was negatively related to levels of psychological hostility. In contrast, under good leadership conditions, a lower level of analysis appears to be operative: Individual reports of task significance were negatively related to psychological hostility. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

An example of the buffering effects of leadership climate,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"In this article, we provide a detailed example of how Random Group Resampling (RGR) can be used to empirically identify group effects with an example involving the buffering effects of leadership climate. RGR provides a tool for statistically determining whether group-level relationships are the result of true group phenomenon (group effects) or the result of aggregating individual data to the group level (grouping effects). Here, we present a group-level model of the stress-buffering hypothesis. Using this group-level perspective, we propose that the average perceptions of leadership climate within Army Companies will moderate the relationship between unit task significance and unit hostility. An unweighted group-means analysis revealed significant buffering effects. Following the unweighted group-means analysis, we used RGR to determine whether the significant interaction was a function of the aggregation process (grouping effects) or a function of the group-level properties of the data (group effects). The RGR analysis indicated that the interaction was related to the group-level properties or the data, and was not merely a by-product of the aggregation process. We conclude by discussing the flexibility of RGR and use it to supplement a within and between analyses (WABAs).

More specifically, (1) peer nominations of leaders and teacher ratings of leadership behavior are significantly correlated, (2) the predictors of peer nominations of leaders overlap with the predictors of teacher ratings, (3) peer nominations of leaders are only modestly related to peer nominations of friendship and popularity, (4) the personal attributes that are significant correlates of popularity and friendship are somewhat different from the correlates of leadership, and (5) the most consistent predictors unique to leadership (across time lags, ratings source, and facets of leadership) are the Judging-Perceiving (JP) dimension of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and grade point average (GPA).

187,"Avolio B.J., Locke E.E.",Contrasting different philosophies of leader motivation. Altruism versus egoism,Leadership Quarterly,2002,"In this series of letters, Avolio and Locke compare and contrast their different views on leadership motivation, considering how selfish and self-sacrificing altruistic behavior influence leaders and follower motivation and performance. Locke bases his main arguments in both letters on the premise that leaders should act and think in a rational way, with selfish interest as the basis for action. By accomplishing their selfish interests, leaders will exhibit their highest principles and performance. Avolio argues that Locke's view on selfish interest is simply too idealistic. Since leadership is seen as being in the eye of the beholder, there is a point where all of the rational decision making in the world does not change the subjective views followers have of their leaders. Moreover, there are numerous situations where everyone's self- or selfish interests cannot be satisfied and it is in those situations that the assumptions of egoistic leadership appear to breakdown. Their debate leads to some interesting suggestions for future research comparing these two divergent views of leader motivation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Unfortunately, however, it is still not commonplace for theory to clearly specify, and for investigations to directly test, expected and rival level-of-analysis effects. This article first selectively reviews a cross-section of theories, models, and approaches in leadership, showing generally poor alignment between theory and the level of analysis actually used in its testing. A multiple levels of analysis investigation of the Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) model is next presented. This theory has as its foundation the dyadic relationship between a supervisor and his or her subordinates. Yet, less than 10% of published LMX studies have examined level of analysis-and none has employed dyadic analysis. Using within- and between-entities analysis (WABA) and two different samples, four LMX level-of-analysis representations are tested, which involve monosource data; three of these models are then tested using heterosource data. Overall, good support is found for the LMX approach at the within-groups and between-dyads levels.

174,"Marion R., Uhl-Bien M.",Leadership in complex organizations,Leadership Quarterly,2001,"This paper asks how complexity theory informs the role of leadership in organizations. Complexity theory is a science of complexly interacting systems; it explores the nature of interaction and adaptation in such systems and how they influence such things as emergence, innovation, and fitness. We argue that complexity theory focuses leadership efforts on behaviors that enable organizational effectiveness, as opposed to determining or guiding effectiveness. Complexity science broadens conceptualizations of leadership from perspectives that are heavily invested in psychology and social psychology (e.g., human relations models) to include processes for managing dynamic systems and interconnectivity. We develop a definition of organizational complexity and apply it to leadership science, discuss strategies for enabling complexity and effectiveness, and delve into the relationship between complexity theory and other currently important leadership theories.

The findings are explained in terms of the similar features of Machiavellianism and charismatic leadership including high levels of expressive behavioral activity, self-confidence, emotional regulation, and the desire to influence others. Also, the idea that personalized and socialized charismatic leadership are not mutually exclusive concepts is supported. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035457532&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2801%2900082-0&partnerID=40&md5=4a93fcca16fda5b12d831431c3c345df

In this article, however, we will argue that outstanding leadership need not always involve charisma but may instead be based on a functional, problem-centered approach we refer to as a pragmatic leadership strategy. Initially, certain key propositions pertaining to the nature of pragmatic leadership are described. Subsequently, these propositions are evaluated with respect to 10 cases of noteworthy leadership evidenced by Benjamin Franklin. It is argued that pragmatic leaders, such as Franklin, exercise influence by identifying and communicating solutions to significant social problems, working through elites in solution generation, creating structures to support solution implementation, and demonstrating the feasibility of these solutions. The conditions under which this pragmatic approach can effectively be applied are discussed and contrasted with current views of the conditions calling for charismatic, transformational, and transactional leadership. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035457254&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2801%2900080-7&partnerID=40&md5=1404bb9b96597d3d29ba0cc23a0deee7

The major purpose is to show that perceptions of leadership are influenced by the manner in which leadership behaviors are combined. Different combinations of task-oriented leadership statements and socioemotionally oriented leadership statements were examined. All of the participants were full-time employees. In all three of the studies, combinative aspects of leadership style clearly influenced perceptions of leadership statements. The findings indicate that task-oriented leadership should not be provided without socioemotional leadership and that socioemotionally oriented leadership should generally be provided immediately before task-oriented leadership. Further work is needed to investigate the applicability of combinative aspects of leadership style to components of transactional and transformational leadership. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035457253&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2801%2900079-0&partnerID=40&md5=b49387a8c3fd34384dfcc90dde44bb23

Little is known, however, about the role of values and motives on the ratings of leadership in assessment center settings. The present study examined the interrelationships between motives and values, personality, and rated leadership performance in a military assessment center designed for Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets. We examined power and affiliation, two value orientations found to predict leadership effectiveness as measured by managerial/leader performance in McClelland and Burnham's leader motive pattern (LMP). We expand on past research using the LMP by studying its utility in an assessment center setting and by positing that the personality factor of extraversion acts a mediator of the values-leadership linkage.

Most leadership researches concentrate exclusively on one or the other area and there are few integrative approaches. The literature also shows that there are often implicit assumptions of a direct and linear relationship between the two sets of concepts. We introduce a model reflecting this research dichotomy by differentiating between ""far-from-action"" concepts like values or leadership ideals and ""close-to-action"" concepts like intended behavior. In a next step, we question the assumption of a direct and linear link between the two sets of concepts and discuss two studies in order to find out whether there is empirical support for our argument. We compare empirical findings on leadership ideals (GLOBE study) and intended leadership behavior (Vroom/Yetton study) collected from managers in the German-speaking countries Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. The results show inconsistencies that suggest quite complex intrapersonal processes influenced by cultural factors. We conclude that the link between ""far-from-action"" and ""close-to-action"" concepts is worth pursuing further and expands the initial model, thus paving the way for a more holistic understanding of the intrapersonal processes on which leadership behavior is based.

In fact, this review demonstrates that scholars, teachers, and practitioners have a range of relevant materials from which to draw information and ideas. An enormous amount of work remains to be done before the literature on public leadership reaches a critical mass.

In adulthood, these models are reflected in attachment styles which are manifested in various realms (e.g., romantic relationships). This article expands the conceptualization derived from attachment theory to the area of leadership. The arguments presented are anchored in the similarity found in the literature between characteristics of the secure attachment style and those of transformational leaders. The central hypothesis is that the style of transformational leadership will correlate positively with the secure attachment style. This hypothesis was examined in three studies conducted in officers' courses, using different sources of report in each study.

275,"Hooijberg R., Choi J.",Which leadership roles matter to whom? An examination of rater effects on perceptions of effectiveness,Leadership Quarterly,2000,"Using a 360-degree feedback approach, we examined the extent to which raters vary in the leadership roles they associate with effectiveness, as well as the extent to which self-ratings reflect those of other raters. Using data from 252 managers and their subordinates, peers, and superiors from the public utility industry, we found that, depending on the rater-ratee relationship, different leadership roles are associated with effectiveness. The managers themselves resembled their superiors the most in terms of the leadership roles they associated with effectiveness. These results lend support for the importance of 360-degree feedback for both practitioners and researchers. Organizational researchers, then, should not only examine levels of rater agreement, but also try to better understand what different raters consider critical leadership roles. This article is a step in that direction. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0043230138&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2800%2900044-8&partnerID=40&md5=4e7e1ffbb75904ad691aefd146d3a272

Numerous studies have clarified the effect, and mediating mechanisms of leadership and self-expectations have been identified. However, a number of factors limit the application of the Pygmalion effect to the workplace. These include its lack of generalizability to women and established work groups, its subconscious nature, the ethical questions surrounding the deceptive procedure used to create the effect, and the failure of Pygmalion training. The primary purpose of this article is to present a review of these problems and to offer suggestions for dealing with them. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042971896&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2800%2900046-1&partnerID=40&md5=5e48830d42ea07797aca74632ca89b5f

The intent in the present article was to first identify types or subgroups of individuals entering the U.S. Army based on ability, personality, and motivational characteristics, and subsequently identify which types tend to be found in upper level positions. A Ward and Hook cluster analysis revealed seven types in a sample of junior Army officers. Three of these types are also particularly prominent among upper level Army leadership positions. The seven types displayed some differences in skills and patterns of career development. Based on these findings, it was concluded that organizations should recognize the need for different types of people to fill different types of organizational leadership roles. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0012574193&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2899%2900045-4&partnerID=40&md5=4a29bd632bda3a4b5057f08f2eefd1f9

This analysis leads to development of the doom and gloom arguments about the field in the 1970s and early 1980s. Transformational and charismatic leadership is discussed as it takes off following the doom and gloom period. That takeoff is followed by revisiting the shift to transformational/charismatic leadership and considering why some of the leading and next-generation scholars set off in this new direction. I then link transformational/charismatic leadership with more traditional approaches and finish with conclusions concerning forces for change, assessing where the leadership field is currently, and providing a future assessment with some caveats. I conclude that a crucial contribution of transformational/charismatic leadership has been in terms of its rejuvenation of the leadership field, regardless of whatever content contributions it has made.

It provides a case study of a longitudinal qualitative variety suggested by Jermier and Kerr in their 1997 symposium contribution. The case documented is the foundation and first decade (1951-1961) of the famous Australian school, Timbertop. In particular the article considers the role played by the founder, J. R.

On the basis of the case data it is argued that the leadership couple is a common, but neglected, substitute for the single-handed leader.

As a result, our knowledge about these leadership forms has deepened, and there are several dominant theories that are now established paradigms in the leadership field. At the same time, despite advances, there are numerous dimensions of these leadership forms about which we still know very little. Given this moment in the field's evolution, it is only appropriate that we take stock of where we have been and where we need to go into the future. We therefore provide an overview of the evolution of charismatic and transformational leadership in organizations. We examine progress along the following dimensions: 1) leader behaviors and their effects; 2) follower dispositions and dependency dynamics; 3) contextual factors; 4) institutionalization and succession forces; and 5) the liabilities of charismatic and transformational leaders. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000418962&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2899%2900012-0&partnerID=40&md5=ec2a02f8621c9d641db07baa30ddf946

This paper argues that to be truly transformational, leadership must be grounded in moral foundations. The four components of authentic transformational leadership (idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration) are contrasted with their counterfeits in dissembling pseudo-transformational leadership on the basis of (1) the moral character of the leaders and their concerns for self and others; (2) the ethical values embedded in the leaders' vision, articulation, and program, which followers can embrace or reject; and (3) the morality of the processes of social ethical choices and action in which the leaders and followers engage and collectively pursue. The literature on transformational leadership is linked to the long-standing literature on virtue and moral character, as exemplified by Socratic and Confucian typologies. It is related as well to the major themes of the modern Western ethical agenda: liberty, utility, and distributive justice Deception, sophistry, and pretense are examined alongside issues of transcendence, agency, trust, striving for congruence in values, cooperative action, power, persuasion, and corporate governance to establish the strategic and moral foundations of authentic transformational leadership. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000242028&doi=10.1016%2fS1048-9843%2899%2900016-8&partnerID=40&md5=3391686e3a10236b8b28d1c583bbe2b8

We develop and present a series of propositions linking contextual variable to the emergence and effectiveness of charismatic leadership.

Information pertaining to Bill Clinton and Bob Dole was collected from published biographical material and synthesized into personality profiles using Millon's diagnostic criteria. President Clinton was found to be primarily Asserting/self-promoting and Outgoing/ gregarious, whereas Senator Dole emerged from the assessment as primarily Controlling/dominant and Conforming/dutiful. A dimensional reconceptualization of the results to examine convergences among the present Millon-based findings, Simonton's dimensions of presidential style, and the five-factor model suggests that Clinton is predominantly charismatic/extraverted, whereas Dole is deliberative/conscientious and relatively low on interpersonality/agreeableness. The profile for Bill Clinton is consistent with a presidency troubled by ethical questions and lapses of judgment, and provides an explanatory framework for Clinton's high achievement drive and his ability to retain a following and maintain his self-confidence in the face of adversity. © 1998 JAI Press Inc.

This approach was chosen given that there is relatively little evidence regarding the nature of effective leadership as organizations pursue QI, potential differences across managerial levels, and the persistence of leadership as QI efforts evolve. Our qualitative analyses involved the identification of relevant themes or categorical schemes, data collection in an open and somewhat unstructured manner, and theory development in line with the data collected. Based on the analyses, we develop a proposed model of alternative paths of leadership and managerial commitment in association with a QI process. One path involves continuing commitment toward QI efforts and results in a culture shift. In contrast, a second path involves wavering commitment and could lead to negative outcomes such as cynicism about the possibility of organizational change. In sum, this study demonstrates the potential value of pursuing an inductive approach in leadership research. © 1998 JAI Press Inc.

Taking advantage of certain methodological assets, the current study examined the British monarchs who governed between 1066 and 1811. After dividing this period into 110 5-year periods, the leadership performance was assessed on 17 criteria. Using a multivariate multiple regression analysis, these criteria were regressed on both chronological age and career age (using both linear and quadratic terms), along with five control variables. Although nine performance criteria exhibited no developmental changes, five were a curvilinear function of career age, two were a curvilinear function of chronological age, and one was a curvilinear function of both chronological and career age. The findings suggest that leader performance is determined by several processes that bear distinct relationships with life-span changes. © 1998 JAI Press Inc.

The total sample consisted of 220 supervising managers from a large public utility. We collected data in three waves which involved pretest, performance rating, and posttest surveys (49 leaders had valid data from all three waves of measurement). We hypothesized that overall ratings, organizational support, and perceived rater ability would be positively related to four reaction criteria (acceptance and perceived usefulness of subordinate feedback and peer feedback). Results showed that overall ratings were related to acceptance of peer and subordinate feedback, but were less consistently related to perceptions of feedback usefulness. For perceived usefulness of subordinate feedback, organizational support accounted for unique variance beyond overall ratings, and perceived rater ability was marginally significant. None of the predictions for perceived usefulness of peer feedback were significant. The authors discuss limitations, implications, and suggestions for future research. © 1998 JAI Press Inc.

We collected self-ratings from the managers concerning their ability and motivation to engage in self-monitoring. SM ability was positively related to supervisor and assessor ratings of interpersonal effectiveness (e.g., empowerment, managing teams, influencing others) but was unrelated to supervisor and assessor ratings of business competence (e.g., planning, decision making, strategic thinking, business knowledge). In contrast, SM motivation was negatively related to peer ratings of business competence. Still, SM explained relatively little variance in 360-degree ratings. 360-degree ratings do not appear to be contaminated by the target manager's SM; the small but significant relationship between SM ability and ratings appears to be job-related (and therefore desirable). © 1998 JAI Press Inc.

Respondents were 554 Israeli combat soldiers who completed five questionnaires describing their perceptions of either their platoon commander or their battalion commander. The results showed that the attribution of charisma to socially close leaders is related to the ascription of extraordinary traits to the leader and to the perception both of the leader as a behavioral model and of his confidence in the individual. The attribution of charisma to distant leaders was related to a willingness to accept the leader's ideas, the perceived confidence of the leader in the group, the ascription of extraordinary traits to the leader, and a general positive impression of the leader.

The current study extends work of the past by developing a multi-variable pattern approach, along with the traditional examination of individual trait measures, in the domain of emergent leadership. The personality pattern examined in this study uses the variables dominance, intelligence and general self-efficacy. All three trait variables were significantly positively associated with leader emergence. Individuals high in all three traits (HHH) emerged significantly more frequently than all other individuals while those low in all three traits (LLL) emerged significantly less frequently than all other individuals.

Followers completed surveys measuring leader reward, punishment, and charisma. Leaders completed peer rankings of effectiveness. Critical incident data on leadership were collected to gauge follower reactions to punishment. Correlation and ordinary least squares were used to analyze the relationships between rewards, punishment, charisma, and effectiveness. Chi-square statistics were used to compare follower reactions to contingent and noncontingent punishment. Results indicated noncontingent reward and contingent punishment were positively related to follower perceptions of leader charisma, while contingent reward was positively related to leader effectiveness.

We propose in this article that there are at least three motivational grounds for persuading followers to change their organizational behavior: utility, identity, and values. These motivational grounds are sensitive to the national (and corporate) contexts in which leaders operate. Here, we discuss two CEO-led change programs, one in a U.S. company and the other in a Japanese organization. We seek to describe and contrast the motivational bases of the CEOs' change efforts in the two cases and draw attention to the leader approaches in the two national and organizational contexts. In the U.S. case study, leadership was based on the assumption that a ""right"" agency (in terms of utility sought or values held) will result in the ""right"" consequences. In Japan, the link from leadership to followership was different: it was assumed that a ""right"" (corporate) identity will induce ""right"" behavior on the part of the followers. We propose that further studies consider the follower context in more detail, thus contributing to the understanding of what makes leaders effective in the United States and Japan. © 1997 JAI Press Inc.

In this study we use factor analysis and content analysis to identify culturally specific aspects of managerial influence, and extend the applicability of a popular North American measure of managerial influence (POIS) to Japanese managers. We find that Japanese managers use some influence tactics and strategies previously reported by North American managers, such as assertiveness, sanctions, and appeals to higher authority.

The primary goals of the analyses were a replication of prior tests of a within-jobs view of the theory, and an across-jobs test of the theory wherein job level was used as a predictor of optimal leadership style. Evidence demonstrated that the theory, as originally formulated, has little descriptive utility. However, further analyses suggested that supervisory monitoring and consideration may interact with job level such that monitoring has a positive impact for lower level employees, while consideration has a more positive impact for higher level employees. The interaction suggests that some of the intuitively-appealing aspects of the theory may be correct, but that couching these processes in terms of readiness/maturity and the Ohio State dimensions of initiation structure and consideration is incorrect. © 1997 JAI Press Inc.

Using a sample of 135 Mexican workers and their managers, this study assessed the effects of leader-member demographic similarity on members' organizational attachment (absence and organizational commitment) in a North Mexican manufacturing facility. Results showed that leader-member gender similarity was negatively associated with absence, and this effect was stronger for dyads with female leaders than for dyads with male leaders. Age similarity had mixed effects on attachment. While it had a negative association with absence (an indicator of lack of attachment), it also had a negative association with organizational commitment (an indicator of attachment).

Other elements contributing to the strong motivational and emotive effects of charismatic rhetoric are construction of the message, style and delivery. CEOs play an important part in creating and dispersing organizational values and visions to organization members and the external environment. Their speeches within and outside the company are important to motivate others and gain support for their vision. The CEOs in this study are from companies seeking different degrees and types of international involvement. Their corporate visions reflect different international business mentalities. This study explores how these charismatic CEOs rhetorically construct message content in their speeches, focusing on how their attitude towards internationalization and international business strategy is reflected. First, international strategy and attitudes towards internationalization as well as vision, charisma and rhetoric are discussed. Discourse analysis is described and examples of rhetorical devices are given from the analyzed speeches of the CEO's.

81,"Peterson M.F., Hunt J.G.",International perspectives on international leadership,Leadership Quarterly,1997,"The ever-increasing awareness by businesses in every part of the world that distant organizations and distant events affect their own activities is driving new thinking about leadership just as it has affected all areas of business. Corporate-level leaders - chief executives and top-level management teams - find themselves challenged by a broad array of strategic alternatives for engaging in global competition. Leaders at all organization levels find themselves concerned with matters of multicultural relations and whether, what, and how cross-border learnings may be possible. Scholars working with international leadership find motivation for their research in these pressing problems. They grapple with questions of how far scientific social research can take us, and how the organization science ideas and methods developed in the United States and other technologically-advanced societies can be used elsewhere in the world. In this article, we deal with the kinds of efforts underway to deal with tensions between global consistency and local uniqueness in the nature and exercise of phenomena related to what social scientists have come to analyze under the label ""leadership."" These tensions affect scholarly exchange no less than they affect multinational management. This article offers a context for this focus for both international leadership research, in general, and the work in this special issue, in particular. © 1997 JAI Press Inc.

Conflicting viewpoints exist in the leadership literature concerning the transferability of specific leader behaviors and processes across cultures. This study explored these conflicting views for managers and professional workers by empirically testing specific hypotheses which addressed the generalizability of leadership behaviors and processes across five nations in North America and Asia. Confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence for conceptual and measurement equivalence for all six leader behaviors employed in the study. The findings showed cultural universality for three leader behaviors (supportive, contingent reward, and charismatic), and cultural specificity for the remaining three leader behaviors (directive, participative, and contingent punishment). © 1997 JAI Press Inc.

Using differences between self- and subordinate ratings, managers (N = 2,056) were first categorized into four groups: over-estimators (who rated themselves higher than others rated them); under-estimators (who rated themselves lower than others rated them); in-agreement/good raters (whose self-ratings were favorable and similar to the ratings of others); and, in-agreement/poor raters (whose self-ratings were unfavorable and similar to the ratings of others) (Atwater & Yammarino, in press). Then, managers were classified using a six group model (Brutus, Fleenor,& Taylor, 1996), which introduced a further distinction - over-estimators/good, and under-estimators/poor. With the four group model, superiors appeared to rate in-agreement/good raters and under-estimators as more effective than over-estimators. However, with the six group model, in-agreement/good raters and under-estimator/good raters were not seen as more effective than over-estimator/good raters. The results suggested that six groups are necessary to fairly compare agreement groups. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

119,Leavy B.,On studying leadership in the strategy field,Leadership Quarterly,1996,"This article is primarily concerned with the study of leadership in the strategy field. It argues that as our perspective on the strategy process itself changes so too must our perspective on top leadership and our approaches to studying it. From a review of the literature the article identifies some of the current issues and challenges in studying leadership and strategy and argues for more dynamic and contextually-sensitive approaches than those that have dominated up to now. It presents and develops a framework for the future study of leadership based on three main foundations: Mintzberg's (1978) concept of strategy formation, Pettigrew's (1985) contextualism, and the author's empirical studies to date. The framework focuses on the process of leadership and its role within the more inclusive process of strategy formation. This process-within-a-process perspective, it is argued, potentially opens the way to gaining fresh perspective on leadership by inviting attention to such underexplored issues as how and why leadership effectiveness varies with time and context, how the symbolic and substantive aspects of leadership interact to produce outcomes of strategic significance, and how successive leaders and their tenures are connected in the strategy formation process over time. At a time when the field of sociology is showing an increasing interest in the concept of strategy, there appears to be great scope for a more serious infusion of the sociological perspective in the opposite direction, and frameworks, such as the one presented in this paper, may help to get such a movement underway. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

118,"Ellis S., Nadler A., Rabin A.",Political leaders in the SYMLOG space: Perceptions of right and left wing leaders by right and left wing constituencies,Leadership Quarterly,1996,"Systematic Multiple Level Observation of Groups (SYMLOG) was applied to studying images of political leaders. Three left wing and three right wing Israeli leaders were evaluated by left and right wing voters along the SYMLOG's three dimensions - friendliness, task orientation, and dominance. It was found that right wing voters rated right wing leaders higher on friendliness and task orientation than left wing leaders. In a similar fashion, left wing voters viewed left wing leaders as more friendly and task-oriented than right wing leaders. Leaders of the right were viewed as more dominant than leaders of the left by left and right wing voters alike. Right and left wing voters assigned different SYMLOG types to right and left wing leaders. The dimension that distinguished between the various images was the dimension of friendliness. Whereas for right wing voters, all images of right wing leaders included a component of friendliness, none of these three images included an accented component of friendliness when rated by left wing voters. In a similar fashion, left wing voters saw two out of the three left wing leaders as including a component of friendliness, whereas none of the three left wing images included this component for right wing voters. Respondents from the right and the left rated their ""ideal leader"" as reflecting values of ""dominance"", ""friendliness,"" and ""task-orientation"". However, respondents saw leaders affiliated with their own political camp as closer to their image of the ideal leader on friendliness and task-orientation than leaders of the opposite political camp. Both right and left wing voters saw all political leaders as equally similar to their image of ""ideal leader"" on the ""dominance"" dimension regardless of that leader's political affiliation. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Based on the work of Georgopolous, Mahoney, and Jones (1957) and the doctoral dissertation and earlier work of Evans (1968, 1970), House's path-goal conceptualization of leadership used Vroom's (1964) expectancy theory of motivation to identify the effects of leader behavior on subordinate outcome variables. An obvious question that comes to mind almost 2-12 decades later is: Where has such a road taken those of us in the leadership field?

Transformational leadership scales of the MLQ were found to be reliable and significantly predicted work unit effectiveness across the set of studies examined. Moderator variables suggested by the literature, including level of the leader (high or low), organizational setting (public or private), and operationalization of the criterion measure (subordinate perceptions or organizational measures of effectiveness), were empirically tested and found to have differential impacts on correlations between leader style and effectiveness. The operationalization of the criterion variable emerged as a powerful moderator.

37,House R.J.,"Path-goal theory of leadership: Lessons, legacy, and a reformulated theory",Leadership Quarterly,1996,"In this paper I present a retrospective review of the development and history of the path-goal theory of leader effectiveness. I briefly describe the origin of the theory. The theory is then summarized. The various methodologies that have been used to test the theory and lessons learned from empirical testing are discussed. Two legacies of the theory are described: the substitutes for leadership theory and the 1976 theory of charismatic leadership. A reformulated 1996 path-goal theory of work unit leadership is presented. The reformulated theory specifies leader behaviors that enhance subordinate empowerment and satisfaction and work unit and subordinate effectiveness. It addresses the effects of leaders on the motivation and abilities of immediate subordinates and the effects of leaders on work unit performance. The reformulated theory includes 8 classes of leader behavior, individual differences of subordinates, and contingency moderator variables which are related to each other in 26 propositions. The contingency moderators of the theory specify some of the circumstances in which each of the behaviors are likely to be effective or ineffective. It is argued that the essential underlying rationale from which the propositions are derived is strikingly parsimonious. The essence of the theory is the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates ' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance. This meta proposition, and the specific propositions derived from it, are consistent with, and integrate, the predictions of current extant theories of leadership. Further, the propositions of the theory are consistent with empirical tests with empirical generalizations resulting from earlier task and person oriented research. It is my hope that the 1996 theory will be subjected to empirical tests and that such tests will lead to a further improved theory to be formulated at some future time. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

This article outlines some of the advantages of qualitative investigations of leadership and reports the results of an investigation of police leadership in England in which a qualitative approach was employed. Drawing on ideas from the New Leadership approach, data deriving from semi-structured interviews with a sample of police officers were analyzed in terms of concepts deriving from typical New Leadership findings. While many findings were consistent with New Leadership approaches, some important divergences emerged too. For example, charisma emerged as much less prominent in notions of what makes an effective leader than might have been expected from New Leadership research; by contrast, instrumental leadership was far more pervasive in police officers' thinking as central to effective leadership. The reasons for such findings are speculated upon. particularly with respect to the sensitivity to context that is a feature of qualitative research. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

We discuss four types of work on diversity: (a) the management literature on interpersonal and intergroup interaction; (b) other management literature on organizational change which has implications for diversity; (c) literature from the social and behavioral sciences which is about diversity, but which has not been included in the management literature on diversity or leadership; and (d) literature on the ethics and morality of diversity and multiculturalism which the management literature has tended to ignore. We argue that leaders need to ""do"" diversity in the origination, interpolation, and use of structures; that they have responsibility for the impact their companies have on a diverse world; that they are implicated by their inaction and inattention as well as by their actions; that they need to take responsibility for the politics of diversity; and that they need to engage in ""adaptive"" and ""emotion"" work. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Leaders wishing to root out segregation, however, must begin by changing biases and stereotypes embedded in human cognitive and behavioral processes. Voluntary organizations, which are premised on change through follower concern and collective commitment, would appear to have optimal motives for reducing segregation. Yet, because leaders of such organizations face problems of communicating their vision for change as well as lack direct control over follower responses, leaders may not accomplish desegregation as a goal. Moreover, the presence of pluralistic interests and viewpoints may further complicate the leader's goals. The study examined how leaders integrated interests and created shared symbolic meanings of common activities, problems, and concerns using varieties of informal power. It analyzed pastors of urban churches and found they used four key influence strategies: (a) raising awareness and support for different racial, ethnic, cultural, and gender interests across organizations; (b) using cognitive dissonance, expertise, and credibility to introduce and modulate change; (c) giving voice to different stories; and (d) mediating transcendent vision and lived experiences. Based on the findings, the article suggests ways in which leaders in similar organizational structures, such as self-directed and team-based forms, can influence change. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

This paper challenges the practice of applying these culturally distinct models to all populations, particularly African-American women executives. We discuss two problematic assumptions that underlie the Anglo-dominated gender and leadership research: (a) racism and sexism are parallel processes with common effects on racial and gender groups (Smith & Stewart, 1983); and (b) women are sufficiently homogeneous so that generalizations based on one group (Anglo-American, middle-class women) can explain the leadership styles of all women. We propose that African-American women executives' leadership styles and behaviors may reflect attributes of both the Anglo-male and female leadership models, as well as a distinctly African-American female approach to leadership. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

111,Thomas K.M.,Psychological privilege and ethnocentrism as barriers to cross-cultural adjustment and effective intercultural interactions,Leadership Quarterly,1996,"The increased occurrence of intercultural contact necessitates a better understanding of why sojourner assignments and expatriate positions often result in the traveler returning home early. Furthermore, increasing diversity within individual locales further mandates a better understanding of how to facilitate effective intercultural interactions. This paper proposes that a better understanding of home country privilege, and of the pervasiveness of ethnocentric world views when working abroad or with others who are somehow ""different,"" may impede one's probability of adjustment and subsequently of success. It is suggested that interventions and training programs geared toward improving the success rates of intercultural relationships should rely less on models that reinforce ethnocentricity and attend more to developing bicultural and multicultural identities in potential sojourners. The ethnic identity literature is reviewed in order to understand how a bi- or even multi-cultural identity may develop. Furthermore, it is suggested that tools for coping and succeeding in novel cultures may be revealed by examining the bicultural life experiences and strategies used by minority group members within the American cultural context. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Results show an indirect effect on leaders' self efficacy, mediated by leaders' estimation of group performance levels. Group heterogeneity is associated with more negative group performance, with a resultant decline in the leaders' self efficacy. In addition to this indirect effect, group heterogeneity has a direct and independent effect on leaders' self efficacy.

Hypotheses, derived from Nancy Chodorow's theory of gender formation, reflected the theme that female managers' influence process would be characterized by interdependency and social connection, while male managers' influence process would be characterized by independence and autonomy. Hypotheses were embedded in a five-stage influence process model and tested using interview and survey data. Results from a matched sample of managers in a Fortune 100 company indicate that female managers were more likely to act out of organizational interest, consider others' viewpoints, involve others in planning, and focus on both task and interpersonal aspects of the influence episode. By contrast, male managers were more likely to act out of self-interest, show less concern with others' feelings, plan alone, and focus primarily on task aspects of the influence episode.

Forty pairs of practicing managers (40 men and 40 women in same- and mixed-gender pairs) took part in a simulated negotiation in which the parties differed in organizational power. This design permitted the testing of several hypotheses about the direct effects of gender and power, as well as the question of whether gender and power would accumulate to men's advantage and women's disadvantage. Results show that managerial women expressed less confidence and less satisfaction with their own performance than managerial men but did not differ in their behavior or in the outcomes they achieved. High-power managers, of both genders, attempted to engage in cooperative behavior with their partners, and believed they achieved cooperative outcomes. But low-power managers were more competitive and felt they gained their own ends at the expense of the other party. Some interactions between gender and power are suggested by the results, but none of them match predictions from existing theory. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

74,Berdahl J.L.,Gender and leadership in work groups: Six alternative models,Leadership Quarterly,1996,"Interest in understanding the dynamics of gender and leadership has blossomed in recent years as occupations and organizations have become less sex-segregated. Much of the work in this area has failed to draw on the wealth of theoretical work that addresses the dynamics of gender in social interaction. The aim of this article is to review several theoretical traditions within the gender literature that have social psychological implications for emergent status structures for groups of varying sex compositions over time. Six models are developed with competing predictions for leadership emergence and status structures, and existing evidence is compared with model predictions. The article concludes by noting that greater understanding can be reached by performing competitive tests of a variety of models, such as the ones presented in this article, and doing so by studying groups over time. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Groups of subjects were brought together in a laboratory to complete an In-Basket exercise. The perceived method of leader selection (preferential or merit-based) was manipulated. Fifteen minutes into the task, group members were either informed that the leader was performing very well or that the group was performing very well, or they did not receive any performance information. It was hypothesized that a preferentially selected female leader would receive lower ratings by group members on several dimensions of leader performance (e.g., effectiveness, initiating structure and consideration, contribution to the success of the group) and that group members would be less satisfied with the leader under this condition. Moreover, we expected leader-based information to mitigate the adverse effects of preferential selection. Analyses indicated that preferentially-based selection resulted in lower ratings on prototypical leadership characteristics, lower ratings of leader effectiveness, and a tendency to recommend replacing the leader in future tasks. In addition, signifcant feedback effects were found on ratings of leader behavior, ratings of leader effectiveness, and perceptions of the leader's contribution to the group's performance. Moreover, when group members were provided with specific information about leader performance, the adverse effects of preferential selection were minimized. Results, limitations, and future research are discussed. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Influence tactics by Asian-American and Caucasian-American managers,Leadership Quarterly,1996,"This article reports an empirical study of Asian-American managers' use of influence tactics with superiors and subordinates compared to a group of Caucasian-American managers. Comparisons also were made between self-reported and target-reported influence behaviors of these managers and the extent to which the managers used similar influence tactics with both superiors and subordinates. Interestingly, this study found only minor differences between influence behaviors of Asian-American managers and Caucasian-American managers. Second, this study found differences between self-reported influence tactics and those same tactics as seen by the targets. Finally, the managers studied here, both Asian-American and Caucasian-American, used different influence tactics with superiors as compared to subordinates. The minor differences, with less than 3% of the variance due to managers' different ethnic backgrounds, suggest that differences found in cross-cultural studies may not be generalizable to different ethnic groups within one country. © 1996 JAI Press Inc.

Instead of joining the debate, this article takes another approach and examines the distinction between leadership and management from a broader perspective. It is argued that organicism and mechanicism, two competing theories or worldviews, are deeply embedded in the leadership-management distinction. These two theories, as well as metaphors derived from each, have framed and dominated the scholarly discourse. Consequently, organicism and mechanicism have had an influence on the way scholars talk and write about leadership and management in complex organizations.

The paper draws upon interviews with managers in the construction industry to develop its main argument: that radical critiques of mainstream leadership theory and research often lose sight of the role of subjective interpretation and agency in the formulation and enactment of the ""social myth"" of leadership and that an interpretive approach, which explores individuals' own ""implicit leadership theories,"" can make an important contribution to the further understanding of leadership as a socially constructed phenomenon. © 1995.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1542750729&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2895%2990024-1&partnerID=40&md5=2cc497a3df4d9046e642469261331485

Unfortunately, leaders are not always interested in effecting change for the purpose of benefitting the organization and its members as a whole; rather, the leader may be more interested in personal outcomes. This study tested a model of personality constructs found to contribute to destructive acts in a real-world sample of charismatic leaders.

Leader behavior descriptions were obtained from the leaders and their subordinates; data on advancement and effectiveness were obtained from superiors, peers, and subordinates. The results showed that leader effectiveness was related more closely to subordinate descriptions of leader behavior than to leader self-reported behavior. Behavior descriptions from the two sources were equally effective in predicting a manager's advancement in the organization. The leader behaviors that related most strongly to managerial effectiveness also related most strongly to advancement.

We propose that both affective and cognitive information-processing mechanisms may work at a variety of levels (individual, dyad, and group) to determine followers' perceptions of leaders. Although the role of affective processing in leadership perception has been little investigated, it plays a key role in the rapid formation of a general liking (or disliking) that then sets the basis for more elaborate cognitive and affective processing. Especially interesting is the possibility that the development of mutual liking depends not only upon characteristics of individual followers or leaders but also upon dyadic and group-level influences on affective processing. Cognitive processing is also subject to dyad- and group-level effects, as leader characteristics have the potential to cue different prototypes in dyadic relations. Similarly, groups can influence prototype availability, mood, information used, and other determinants of subsequent leadership perceptions. © 1995.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000134974&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2895%2990010-1&partnerID=40&md5=29982a9be0ae20499ab8fee3f3efa22e

The technique is especially valuable for longitudinal studies, where practical limitations preclude a large number of teams. Although the longitudinal nature of such research often leads to small sample sizes and hence reduced power, repeated measures regression makes it possible to regain some of this power through the use of multiple observations and between teams/within team variance partitioning.

480,Turner S.,Charisma and obedience: A risk cognition approach,The Leadership Quarterly,1993,"Weber's account of charisma solved certain specific problems in the philosophy of law by using a concept from the history of church law. The concept Weber generalized from, originally formulated by R. Sohm, relied on the notion of divine inspiration; Weber's uses required a substitute causal force. The standard substitutes are culturalist, in which the power of the charismatic leader or the state comes from meeting cultural expectations for leaders, or contractual, in which leaders give followers something they want. Neither account squares with the fundamental use of the idea, to explain cultural innovation and internal change in followers. A new model of the character of charisma that fits these needs is proposed. In it, the leader is seen as a person who both offers a choice of a new vision of risks and opportunities and, through his or her own conduct, provides evidence of the realizability of this vision through submission.

Candy Lightner, we see the unfolding of a problem identified by Max Weber: charismatic leadership and rational forms of organization have incompatible elements. An undaunted, emotionally expressive leader driven by a moral mission was an important factor in, first, establishing the legitimacy and salience of the drunk-driving issue in the eyes of the American public, and second, in the formation of a well-funded national organization: MADD. Once organized, the institutional pressures on a non-profit organization to conform to rational administrative practices for its continued legitimacy drew people into MADD who were specialists and functionaries, not followers. The resulting conflict led to the eventual replacement of MADD's founding president. © 1993.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38249004469&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2893%2990038-U&partnerID=40&md5=29dab2f7394509e051988650602e2feb

The sociologist Max Weber (1947) used the term to describe a form of influence based not on tradition or formal authority but rather on follower perceptions that a leader is endowed with exceptional qualities. For many years, charisma was mostly the province of researchers studying political leadership and the leadership of social movements or religious cults. Charisma was rarely considered within the literature on organizational leadership until Bob House proposed a theory of charismatic leadership for leaders in large private and public sector organizations. © 1993.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0010787442&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2893%2990041-Q&partnerID=40&md5=a8c8e2c90825044f952157615c00e7f1

79,"Kalma A.P., Visser L., Peeters A.",Sociable and aggressive dominance: Personality differences in leadership style?,The Leadership Quarterly,1993,"Two types of dominance are distinguished on the basis of questionnaires: sociable dominance and aggressive dominance. In an emergent leadership situation, persons who have a high score on either scale or both scales are dominant according to an external criterion. However, in social interaction these persons attain their goals in a different way. In addition, the higher a person's score on sociable dominance, the higher this person is rated by peers on task leadership. In contrast, the higher a person's score on aggressive dominance, the lower this person is rated on socioemotional leadership. A high scorer on sociable dominance expects to be the center of social activity and attention, and generally reports better social relationships than persons who have a high score on aggressive dominance. These results are supported by observations of nonverbal behavior, which indicate that sociably dominant and aggressively dominant persons differ in the extent to which they verbalize, look at other persons, and receive attention from peers. The types also differ in their need to dominate others, in self-aggrandizing tendencies, and in their tolerance of uncertainty. Both types seem to have characteristics that help, as well as others that hinder, them in being successful leaders. The results complicate rather than elucidate the relations between personality and leadership, and are discussed against the background of a long history of confusing results in attempts to relate personality characteristics to successful leadership. © 1993.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0002954207&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2893%2990003-C&partnerID=40&md5=e03c5e609f149b7f9ec7c94648139ce6

The goal of this study was to explore the possibility that the reason for the lack of support reported by Podsakoff and his colleagues, was their use of a sample comprised primarily of nonprofessionals, by testing the substitutes model using a more professional sample (n = 411 professional, managerial, and whitecollar employees drawn from 10 different organizations).

The results indicate that few of the substitutes variables moderated the relationships between the leader behaviors and the subordinate criterion variables, and that the majority of the moderated relationships identified did not meet the criteria specified by Howell, Dorfman, and Kerr.

Subsequent theoretical development has focused on a change leadership not necessarily related to a change toward higher values. Although the concept of moral leadership must be expanded to include both transformational and transactional factors, this still does not take into account the reality of a leader who effects the retardation or reversal of the developmental process in followers. The premise of this paper is that the leader's orientation toward self and others must be taken into account in order to understand fully the leadership dynamic.

A second study compared the performance of trained group members under directive and nondirective leaders.

104,"Knights D., Morgan G.",Leadership and corporate strategy: Toward a critical analysis,The Leadership Quarterly,1992,"The paper examines the increased interest among leadership writers in the issue of corporate strategy and corporate culture. Academic, consultant, and practitioner literature has increasingly focused on the way in which leadership constitutes effective organizations through shaping values and culture. This has led leadership studies away from the examination of the micro-processes of group formation with its concomitant problems of measurement and analysis and towards the consideration of the role of senior management in leadership. However, the paper rgues, that there has not yet been sufficient critical analysis of the role of leadership in these circumstances. It is argued that corporate leadership of this sort needs to be understood as a specific set of discourses and practices which has particular conditions of possibility. These are located in the changing nature of industry and management in the current era. It is argued that in order to advance, leadership studies need to problematize the discourse of 'leaders"" themselves, rather than accepting them as adequate accounts of how organizations work. © 1992.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0011672972&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2892%2990011-4&partnerID=40&md5=c6e8bf1856ee018f21fdd0169a61bb0c

However, recent emphasis on cognition and affect in organizational behavior suggests that inner states may be important to the outcomes of punishment situations. This paper develops a more integrative model of subordinate reactions to punishment incidents based upon the punishment, justice, and social affect literatures. The model proposes that individual differences, contextual variables, and the leader's management of the punishment incident influence the subordinate's cognitive and affective reactions, which, in turn, influence outcomes. Justice cognitions and emotions are hypothesized to be key mediating process links that explain punishment outcomes. Research propositions are offered to guide future punishment research.

470,Weaver D.R.,Liberalism and leadership: Lockean roots,The Leadership Quarterly,1991,"Liberal thought has paid scant attention to leadership as a conceptual issue. Liberalism has emphasized constraint of public authority yet it has expected leaders to rise to its service. What is the meaning of leadership to a political philosophy so individualistic, contingent and egalitarian? This question opens a new perspective to much examined subjects. Students of leadership and students of liberalism have made no attempt to unite their interests. But, leadership, understood in contemporary terms and applied retrospectively to liberalism, can be a fruitful line of investigation. John Locke's Second Treatise serves as a place to begin. Concern with public power and authority has confused them with leadership to such an extent in the liberal mind that leadership has been largely taken for granted as a function of institutional authority. Liberalism's focus on limiting public authority has distorted its comprehension of the role of leaders in the polity. Yet, Locke's discussion of prerogative wrestles with the necessity of leadership which reaches beyond institutional authority to achieve the public good. Locke's argument may be read to support a view that leadership is necessary, but not sufficient, to the creation, preservation and progress of liberal society. © 1991.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38149144356&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2891%2990008-P&partnerID=40&md5=dbd61a1a38fcd63a2873e54a40ada560

Using archival data from 132 industrial organizations from the Fortune 500 for which data was available over a fifteen year period (1971-1985) in combination with estimates of SDy from a sample of financial analysts (n=41), an after-tax utility point estimate averaging over twenty-five million dollars was computed based upon average executive tenure, illustrating the instrumentality of a high-performing executive leader. The discussion noted that the average percent-impact estimate of the financial analysts was almost identical to the average effect size associated with leadership from two often-cited executive succession studies (Lieberson & O'Connor, 1972; Salancik & Pfeffer, 1977).

Specifically, it is proposed that successful leaders have as individual characteristics two components of social intelligence, social perceptiveness and behavioral flexibility. In essence, leaders are able to ascertain the demands, requirements, and affordances in organizational problem scenarios and tailor their responses accordingly. The qualities of social perceptiveness and behavioral flexibility are based upon well-organized and sophisticated knowledge structures or cognitive representations of the social elements (e.g., organizational members, work behavioral settings, problem scenarios, organizational goals, expected interaction rituals) residing in organizational domains. Five propositions are offered regarding differences between leaders and nonleaders in the nature of these social knowledge structures. Several implications of these arguments are discussed, including (a) viewing leaders as experts in the operations of complex social systems, (b) considering social intelligence as part of a network of leader attributes, and (c) examining differences between leaders and nonleaders in their cognitive qualities and representations. © 1991.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000384296&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2891%2990018-W&partnerID=40&md5=648503511ada65246ffb7a84981ca5ca

A hypothesis that emphasizes the reciprocal and performance-related nature of the events set into motion by performance monitoring was proposed and tested. A randomized two-group experiment was conducted with 60 manager-subordinate pairs. A monitor group in which managers collected information (e.g., sampled the work) was contrasted with an antecedent group in which managers conveyed information (e.g., provided instructions). Using the Operant Superior-Subordinate Taxonomy and Index, trained observers coded both parties' behaviors every 5 seconds. As hypothesized, more subordinate discussions of their own performance and more superior consequences occurred in the monitor vs. antecedent group. Furthermore, the lag sequential analyses revealed a pattern of reciprocal interactions. Monitoring appeared to stimulate subordinates talking about their own performance; this, in turn, set the stage for managers to provide consequences and continue monitoring subordinates' performance. Thus, the documentation of the rich, yet subtle, interaction patterns helped explain the impact of performance monitoring. © 1990.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0347571331&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2890%2990008-6&partnerID=40&md5=3e17737ab1159281bd7a99c1b6a8ddae

In addition, several other measures of leadership experience were obtained. Rated experience and one other measure, relevance of previous positions, were significant predictors of leadership performance. Rated experience was regressed on several predictors to determine the components of leadership experience. The relevance of a leader's previously held positions was found to be the most important determinant. Other measures that have been used as measures of experience, specifically time in service and number of previous positions, did not predict either rated experience or performance. The implications of these findings for organizations and for leadership research are discussed. © 1990.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0038214438&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2890%2990002-Y&partnerID=40&md5=010dd0b9a3c43e9089c9835713db5b44

Generalized beliefs about leadership and charisma were each significantly related to many transactional behaviors measured in the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire-Form XII. Nevertheless, charisma was significantly related to self-reports of extra effort, after controlling for its association to these other transactional measures of leadership. These results imply that transactional behaviors may contribute to the emergence of charisma in smaller organizations where employees have more direct interactions with their top manager. Moreover, our evidence further reinforces that an attribution of charisma, as opposed to transactional behaviors, may be needed to sustain expenditures of extra effort. © 1990.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0009141878&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2890%2990003-Z&partnerID=40&md5=9092da68b5185a3ec3fc6929f77b7928

This article examines the importance of the 12 situational attributes specified by the model in moving actual decision makers from an autocratic to either a consultative or a group decision method. It was found that 8 of the 12 attributes were of significant importance to decision makers in choosing a decision method. Further, all five attributes added to the older Vroom-Yetton model had a significant effect on the choices of decision makers. © 1990.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0007865922&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2890%2990018-D&partnerID=40&md5=55378e88205e0a0ec0670c17f7f5e20c

The international generalizability of four hypotheses of career progress developed from American research were evaluated within a single longitudinal design: Bray's Assessed Management Potential (AMP) hypothesis, Landy's Performance Appraisal (PA) hypothesis, Porter's Organizational Commitment (OC) hypothesis, and Graen's Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) hypothesis. Predictions from each of these four predictors and their pairwise combinations showed that all four predictors especially LMX and PA demonstrated utility as did two of the six pairwise combinations (LMX × AMP and LMX × CO). Two new models of management progress which synthesize the best predictors were developed and offered for further testing. Implications of these findings for the theory and practice of management development and career progress are discussed. © 1990.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0001849247&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2890%2990012-7&partnerID=40&md5=a54beb36d96c42725ac105d76f18935c

Measures of six transformational leader behaviors (Articulating a Vision, Providing an Appropriate Model, Fostering the Acceptance of Group Goals, High Performance Expectations, Individualized Support, and Intellectual Stimulation), one transactional leader behavior (Contingent Reward Behavior), employees' trust in their leader, and satisfaction were obtained from 988 exempt employees of a large petrochemical company. Matching evaluations of five citizenship behaviors of these employees (Altruism, Conscientiousness, Courtesy, Civic Virtue, and Sportsmanship) were obtained from their supervisors. In order to determine whether transformational behaviors augment the impact of transactional behaviors, their effects on followers' trust, satisfaction, and citizenship behaviors were examined in the context of the effect of transactional leader behaviors on these same variables. The results indicate that the effects of the transformational leader behaviors on citizenship behaviors are indirect, rather than direct, in that they are mediated by followers' trust in their leaders. Moreover, these results were found not to be wholly attributable to the effects of common method biases. The implications of these findings for future research on transformational leader behaviors, trust, and organizational citizenship behavior are then discussed. © 1990.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000893909&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2890%2990009-7&partnerID=40&md5=fc4116f9b9941b26f7c610004059c73c

However, the prevailing though implicit assumptions underlying current leadership theory inhibit the systematic study of senior leadership in such technologies. We critique the prevailing view of leadership as context free, selfless, and centered on interpersonal influence, arguing that leadership can instead be viewed as constrained, self-interested, and indirect. We conclude that leaders in high-risk technologies in particular are self-interested within institutional boundaries and tend to become captured by the very myths and institutionalized structures and processes that they use to pattern the attention of their subordinates. Key challenges to leadership research are presented. © 1990.",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000481726&doi=10.1016%2f1048-9843%2890%2990017-C&partnerID=40&md5=0c83935a274abcf061248f6e97c26e59
