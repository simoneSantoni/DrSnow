# natural-experiments

# Overview

This repo contains data, code, and miscellaneous materials on the application
of natural experiments to the social sciences (e.g., economics, organization
theory, political science, and sociology).

This project is organized along two arms:

+ `DrSnow` is a Python library containing a comprehensive collection of
  statistical tools to conduct natural experiments in the social sciences.
+ `background` offers some reviews on the application of natural
   experiments to the social sciences. 


# Status of the project

The source code of `DrSnow` will be released late Summer 2020. The individual
 reviews on natural experiments are released on a rolling-based windows as
  new working or published papers are available.
